To keep myself moving along, I&amp;rsquo;m starting a new plan of writing posts and timeboxing it to half an hour. If I don&amp;rsquo;t finish, then the ending is gonna be awkward isn&amp;rsquo;t it.
See the first one about the new mapping feature!</description></item><item><title>Saildrone and Sam</title><link>https://www.odinseye.cloud/announcements/saildrone/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 17:14:35 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.odinseye.cloud/announcements/saildrone/</guid><description>They sent a drone into a hurricane and sent some video back.
Saildrone is a neat company making autonomous sailing vehicles to drive around the ocean collecting weather data. They have a set that are set up for hurricane conditions, and one of those sent back video from Hurricane Sam while it was at Category 4 strength.

So I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to run Larry until the end of the season when I (re)run everything for the year, as it was supposed to just hang out in the Atlantic making waves for the benefit of various sea creatures. But, its decided to turn from a Tropical Cyclone to an Extratropical System, and respec from water damage to snow damage. It&amp;rsquo;s a bold move, so I&amp;rsquo;m doing a model run of it.</description></item><item><title>2020 Model Runs Are Up</title><link>https://www.odinseye.cloud/announcements/2020modelsup/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 22:25:09 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.odinseye.cloud/announcements/2020modelsup/</guid><description>Model runs for the 2020 year are up! It took about 2 hours for my laptop to chug through running the models, generating maps, and uploading everything, and I triggered my Google Cloud activity alert. But it was a good test of my automation scripts, and everything seems to have gone well! Check them out on the Hurricane page.</description></item></channel></rss>
