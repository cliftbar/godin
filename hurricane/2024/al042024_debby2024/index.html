located inland over South Carolina near latitude 33.2 North,
longitude 79.7 West. Debby is moving toward the northwest near 5
mph (7 km/h) but is expected to accelerate toward the
north-northwest and north across eastern South Carolina and central
North Carolina through tonight. Debby is then expected to move
faster toward the northeast across the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast on Friday and Atlantic Canada on Saturday.</p><p>Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast during the next day or so, and Debby is
likely to become a tropical depression by this afternoon or
evening. Debby should then merge with a front and become
extratropical on Friday.</p><p>Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
to the east of the center. A sustained wind of 36 mph (57 km/h)
and a gust to 39 mph (63 km/h) was recently reported at Cape
Lookout, North Carolina.</p><p>The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).</p><h2 id=hazards-affecting-land>HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND</h2><p>Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.</p><p>WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue along the
coasts of South Carolina and North Carolina within the tropical
storm warning area through today.</p><p>STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide&mldr;</p><p>South Santee River to Ocracoke Inlet including the Neuse and
Pamlico Rivers&mldr;1 to 3 ft</p><p>For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.</p><p>RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce an additional 3 to 6 inches
of rainfall with locally higher amounts, across portions of
southeastern North Carolina leading to maximum storm total amounts
as high as 15 inches. Additional rainfall of 1 to 3 inches over
portions of eastern South Carolina will bring maximum storm total
amounts as high as 20 to 25 inches. Considerable flooding is
expected across portions of eastern South Carolina and southeast
North Carolina through Friday.</p><p>From central North Carolina northward across portions of Virginia, 3
to 7 inches with local amounts to 10 inches, are expected through
Friday. This rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable
flash and urban flooding, with river flooding possible.</p><p>From portions of Maryland north through Upstate New York and
Vermont, 2 to 4 inches, with local amounts to 6 inches, are expected
through Friday night. This will likely result in areas of
considerable flash and urban flooding as well as river flooding.</p><p>For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Debby, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero. For a list of
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see

Carolina this morning. The tornado threat will shift northward
today into central North Carolina and southern to central Virginia.</p><p>SURF: Large swells will continue to affect the Southeast U.S.
coast through the end of the week. These conditions are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.</p><h2 id=next-advisory>NEXT ADVISORY</h2><p>Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM EDT.
