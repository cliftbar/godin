motion toward the north and north-northeast across the Carolinas and
the U.S. Mid-Atlantic states is expected on Thursday and Friday.</p><p>Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h)
with higher gusts. Some additional strengthening is possible today
or tonight before the center of Debby reaches the coast of South
Carolina. Weakening is forecast to begin on Thursday after the
center moves inland. Debby is expected to merge with a frontal
boundary over the U.S. Mid-Atlantic states on Friday.</p><p>Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
from the center.</p><p>The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).</p><h2 id=hazards-affecting-land>HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND</h2><p>Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.</p><p>WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue along the
coast of South Carolina within the tropical storm warning area
through Thursday. Tropical storm conditions are expected
within the tropical storm warning area and possible within the
tropical storm watch area in North Carolina today and continuing
through Thursday.</p><p>STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide&mldr;</p><p>South Santee River to Ocracoke Inlet including the Neuse and
Pamlico Rivers&mldr;1 to 3 ft</p><p>For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.</p><p>RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce an additional 3 to 9 inches
of rainfall with locally higher amounts, leading to maximum storm
total amounts as high as 25 inches in South Carolina and 15 inches
in southeast North Carolina, broadening the area of considerable
flooding across portions of South Carolina and southeast North
Carolina through Friday.</p><p>An additional 1 to 2 inches of rainfall with locally higher amounts
is possible across southeast Georgia through Thursday, bringing
overall storm total amounts as high as 15 inches, which may
aggravate any ongoing flooding conditions.</p><p>From the Piedmont of South Carolina northward across portions of
Virginia, 3 to 7 inches with local amounts to 10 inches, are
expected through Friday. This rainfall will likely result in areas
of considerable flash and urban flooding, with river flooding
possible.</p><p>From Maryland north through Upstate New York and Vermont, 2 to 4
inches, with local amounts to 6 inches, are expected through
Saturday morning. This will likely produce considerable flash and
urban flooding as well as river flooding.</p><p>For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Debby, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at

and extreme eastern South Carolina through tonight.</p><p>SURF: Large swells will continue to affect the Southeast U.S.
