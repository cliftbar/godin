HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Helene can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Over portions of the central and southern Appalachians, 
Helene is expected to produce additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 
inches leading to widespread total rainfall accumulations of 6 to 12 
inches, with isolated totals exceeding 20 inches. This rainfall will 
result in catastrophic and potentially life-threatening flash and 
urban flooding, along with record level river flooding in many 
instances. Numerous significant landslides are expected in steep 
terrain across the southern Appalachians. Elsewhere, 1 to 3 inches 
of rainfall is expected across portions of the Ohio Valley through 
Sunday evening.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Storm Helene, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero. 

For a list of rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated 
this storm, see the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the 
WMO header ACUS44 KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html. 
 
TORNADOES: Isolated tornadoes are possible this afternoon and 
evening over southern Virginia and northeast North Carolina.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Helene will affect the coasts of Georgia
and the Carolinas during the next day or so.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
