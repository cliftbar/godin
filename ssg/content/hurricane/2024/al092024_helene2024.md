## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Helene was
located near latitude 19.9 North, longitude 85.5 West.  Helene is
moving toward the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A turn
toward the northwest is expected later tonight, followed by a
general northward motion beginning on Wednesday and continuing
through Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of Helene will
pass near the northeastern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula later 
tonight or early Wednesday, move across the eastern Gulf of Mexico 
on Wednesday and Thursday, and reach the Big Bend coast of Florida 
late Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast, and Helene is expected to become a
hurricane later tonight or early Wednesday.  The storm is forecast
to rapidly strengthen over the eastern Gulf of Mexico and become a
major hurricane on Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.27 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Helene can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Helene is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches over western Cuba, the Cayman Islands
and the northeast Yucatan Peninsula, with isolated totals around 12
inches. This rainfall brings a risk of considerable flooding.
 
Over the Southeastern U.S., Helene is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches with isolated totals around 12
inches. This rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable
flash and urban flooding, with areas of significant river flooding.
Landslides are possible in areas of steep terrain in the southern
Appalachians.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Helene, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Ochlockonee River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...10-15 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...6-10 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...5-10 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...5-8 ft
Tampa Bay...5-8 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...4-7 ft
Englewood, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Charlotte Harbor...3-5 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the southern
coast of Pinar del Rio, Cuba, including the Isle of Youth.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
ground level in areas of onshore winds within the warning area along
the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area in Mexico on Wednesday. Hurricane conditions are
expected within the U.S. hurricane warning area late Thursday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the
tropical storm warning area in Florida on Wednesday and spread
northward through Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible
within the tropical storm watch area beginning Thursday.
 
TORNADOES: A tornado or two may occur Wednesday night over parts of
the western Florida peninsula and southern Alabama.  The risk of
tornadoes will increase on Thursday, expanding across Florida and
into parts of Georgia and South Carolina.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Helene will affect the southern coast
of Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico during the next couple
of days.  Swells will spread northward toward the west coast of
Florida and the northeastern Gulf Coast on Wednesday and Thursday.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
