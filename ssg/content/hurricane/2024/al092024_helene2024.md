## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Helene was 
located near latitude 35.1 North, longitude 83.8 West. Helene is 
moving toward the north near 32 mph (52 km/h).  A slowdown in 
forward speed is expected soon, and the storm is forecast to stall 
over the Tennessee Valley tonight and through the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Continued weakening is expected, and Helene is 
forecast to become extratropical later today.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 345 miles 
(555 km) east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface 
observations is 975 mb (28.80 inches).  A weather station on 
Sassafras Mountain reported a sustained wind of 41 mph (67 km/h) 
with a gust of 61 mph (98 km/h).  A coastal observation at Murrells 
Inlet recently reported a sustained wind of 38 mph (61 km/h) with a 
gust of 46 mph (74 km/h).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Helene can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: Water levels will continue to receed along the Florida 
Gulf Coast and portions of the southeast U.S. coast throughout the 
day.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occurring along much of the
South Carolina coast, and these conditions will continue for the 
next several hours. Strong, damaging winds, especially in gusts, 
will also continue as far inland as the higher terrain of the 
southern Appalachians.
 
RAINFALL: Over portions of the Central and Southern Appalachians, 
Helene is expected to produce additional rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 
inches leading to total rain accumulations of 6 to 12 inches, with 
isolated totals around 20 inches. This rainfall will result in 
catastrophic and potentially life-threatening flash and urban 
flooding, along with significant and record river flooding. Numerous 
significant landslides are expected in steep terrain across the 
Southern Appalachians.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Storm Helene, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero. 

For a list of rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated 
this storm, see the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the 
WMO header ACUS44 KWBC or at the following link:

TORNADOES: Tornadoes are possible today across eastern South 
Carolina, central and eastern North Carolina, and southern Virginia.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Helene will affect the coasts of Georgia
and the Carolinas during the next day or so.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
