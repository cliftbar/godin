## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Helene was
located near latitude 19.7 North, longitude 84.7 West.  Helene is
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A turn 
toward the northwest is expected tonight, followed by a general 
northward motion beginning on Wednesday and continuing through 
Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of Helene will pass near 
the northeastern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula on Wednesday, move 
across the eastern Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday and Thursday, and 
reach the Big Bend coast of Florida late Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast, and 
Helene is expected to become a hurricane on Wednesday.  The storm 
is forecast to rapidly strengthen over the eastern Gulf of Mexico 
and become a major hurricane on Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
to the east of the center.
 
Data from NOAA buoy 42056 indicate that the minimum central pressure 
is 995 mb (29.39 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Helene can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Helene is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 
4 to 8 inches over western Cuba and the Cayman Islands with isolated 
totals around 12 inches. Over the eastern Yucatan Peninsula, 4 to 6 
inches of rain are expected with isolated totals over 8 inches. 
This rainfall brings a risk of considerable flooding.

Over the Southeastern U.S., Helene is expected to produce total rain 
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches with isolated totals around 12 
inches. This rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable 
flash and urban flooding, with areas of significant river flooding 
likely, including the risk of landslides in areas of steep terrain 
in the southern Appalachians.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Helene, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall 
Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and 
the Flash Flood Risk graphic at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Ochlockonee River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...10-15 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...6-10 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...5-10 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...5-8 ft
Tampa Bay...5-8 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...4-7 ft
Englewood, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Charlotte Harbor...3-5 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the southern
coast of Pinar del Rio, Cuba, including the Isle of Youth.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
ground level in areas of onshore winds within the warning area along
the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning 
area in Mexico on Wednesday. Hurricane conditions are
expected within the U.S. hurricane warning area late Thursday.  
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the 
tropical storm warning area Florida on Wednesday and spread 
northward through Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible 
within the tropical storm watch area beginning Thursday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Helene will affect the southern coast
of Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico during the next couple
of days.  Swells will spread northward toward the west coast of
Florida and the northeastern Gulf Coast on Wednesday and Thursday.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
