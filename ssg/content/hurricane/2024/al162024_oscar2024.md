## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Oscar was 
located near latitude 21.8 North, longitude 75.4 West. Oscar is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 8 mph (13 km/h). A faster 
northeastward motion is expected on Tuesday and Wednesday. On the 
forecast track, the center of Oscar is expected to move near the 
southeastern and central Bahamas on Tuesday.

Data from the Air Force Hurricane Hunters indicate that maximum
sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. Some
gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of days, and
Oscar could degenerate to a post-tropical low by Tuesday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
east and northeast of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
