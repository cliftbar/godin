## Official Advisory Discussion
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Oscar was located 
near latitude 21.4 North, longitude 70.6 West. Oscar is moving 
toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this motion with a gradual 
slowdown and turn to the west-southwest is forecast over the next 
couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds based on aircraft data are near 80 mph (130 
km/h) with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is possible 
today before gradual weakening begins early next week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 5 miles (10 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles
(75 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure measured by dropsonde 
observations is 989 mb (29.21 inches).
