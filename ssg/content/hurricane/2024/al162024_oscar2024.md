## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Oscar was located 
near latitude 20.7 North, longitude 73.9 West. Oscar is moving 
toward the west-southwest near 7 mph (11 km/h). A continued 
west-southwestward motion at a slow forward speed is expected 
through tonight, followed by a turn toward the northwest and north 
on Monday and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Oscar 
is expected to make landfall along the northeastern coast of Cuba 
later this afternoon or evening. The system is then expected to move 
across eastern Cuba tonight and Monday.  Oscar will then accelerate 
northeastward across the central Bahamas on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Oscar is expected to reach the northeastern coast of Cuba as 
a hurricane later this afternoon. Weakening is expected after 
landfall, but Oscar could still be a tropical storm when it moves 
north of Cuba late Monday and moves across the central Bahamas on 
Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles
(75 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure measured by aircraft 
dropsonde observations is 986 mb (29.12 inches).
