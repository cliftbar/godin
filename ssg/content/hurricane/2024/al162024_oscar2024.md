## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Oscar was located 
near latitude 21.4 North, longitude 71.1 West. Oscar is moving 
toward the west near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this motion with a 
gradual slowdown and turn to the west-southwest is forecast tonight 
into tomorrow. A sharp turn to the northeast is anticipated by 
Monday. 
 
Dropsonde wind data indicate that maximum sustained winds have 
increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher gusts. A little more 
strengthening is possible tonight, but gradual weakening is expected 
to begin by Sunday night and Monday. 
 
Oscar is a very small hurricane, with hurricane-force winds only 
extending outward up to 5 miles (10 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on earlier dropsonde 
data is 987 mb (29.15 inches).
