## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Oscar was
located near latitude 20.2 North, longitude 75.1 West. Oscar is
moving toward the west near 2 mph (4 km/h). A turn to the northwest 
and north is expected later today, followed by a faster 
northeastward motion on Tuesday and Wednesday. On the forecast 
track, the center of Oscar is expected to continue moving
across eastern Cuba through this afternoon, then emerge off the
northern coast of Cuba late today or tonight and move near the
southeastern and central Bahamas on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Some additional weakening is likely while  
Oscar moves across the mountainous terrain of eastern Cuba, but 
Oscar is forecast to be a tropical storm when it moves north of Cuba 
late today and then moves near the southeastern and central Bahamas 
on Tuesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
