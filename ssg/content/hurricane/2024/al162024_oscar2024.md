## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Oscar was
located near latitude 20.3 North, longitude 75.4 West.  Oscar is
moving toward the west-northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A turn to 
the northwest and north is expected later today, followed by a 
faster northeastward motion on Tuesday and Wednesday.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Oscar is expected to continue moving 
across eastern Cuba through this afternoon, then emerge off the 
northern coast of Cuba later today or tonight and move near the 
southeastern and central Bahamas on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Some additional weakening is possible while the 
center remains over land today, followed by slight restrengthening 
after the center moves back over water and near the southeastern and 
central Bahamas on Tuesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).

isolated amounts around 8 inches. This rainfall could cause 
localized flash flooding.
