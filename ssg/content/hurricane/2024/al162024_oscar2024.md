## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Oscar was 
located inland over eastern Cuba near latitude 20.3 North, 
longitude 74.6 West. Oscar is moving toward the west-southwest near 
6 mph (9 km/h). A turn to the west and northwest is expected on 
Monday, followed by a faster northeastward motion on Tuesday and 
Wednesday. On the forecast track, the center of Oscar is expected to 
continue moving across eastern Cuba tonight and Monday, then emerge 
off the northern coast of Cuba late Monday and move near the 
southeastern and central Bahamas on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional weakening is expected as Oscar 
interacts with the mountainous terrain of eastern Cuba, but Oscar 
could still be a tropical storm when it moves north of Cuba late 
Monday and then moves near the southeastern and central Bahamas on 
Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.24 inches).
