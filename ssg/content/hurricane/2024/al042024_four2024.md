## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Four
was located near latitude 22.8 North, longitude 82.0 West. The
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 
km/h). A turn toward the northwest is forecast today, followed
by a northward motion on Sunday and then a slower northeastward
motion Sunday night and Monday. On the forecast track, the center
of the depression will move across western Cuba this morning, and
then move over the eastern Gulf of Mexico later today and Sunday,
reaching the Florida Gulf coast late Sunday or Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are now near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Slow strengthening is expected today and tonight, and the 
depression is expected to become a tropical storm tonight.  A 
faster rate of strengthening is expected Sunday through Monday, and 
the system could be near hurricane strength when it reaches the 
Florida Gulf coast.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface
observations from Cuba is 1009 mb (29.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for the depression can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area
by Sunday night, with tropical storm conditions possible earlier on
Sunday. Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread northward
over the warning areas beginning later today and continuing through
Sunday. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in
the Florida Keys later today or tonight, and in the Florida
Panhandle by late Sunday.  Wind gusts to tropical storm force are 
currently occurring over the Florida Keys.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Aripeka, FL to Aucilla River, FL...3-5 ft
Aucilla River, FL to Indian Pass, FL...2-4 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Aripeka, FL...2-4 ft
Tampa Bay...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft

For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation, 
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic, 
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Four is expected to produce rainfall
totals of 5 to 10 inches, with maximum rainfall totals up to 15
inches, across portions of Florida and along the Southeast U.S.
coast this weekend through Thursday morning. This rainfall will
likely result in areas of locally considerable flash and urban
flooding, with river flooding expected.
 
For Cuba, rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches, with localized higher
amounts, will be possible through today. This may result in isolated
to scattered areas of flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Depression Four, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf
 
TORNADOES: A tornado or two is possible across the Florida Keys and
the western Florida Peninsula tonight through Sunday morning.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are expected to affect
much of the Gulf coast of Florida tonight through Monday and along
the Southeast U.S. coast early next week. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
