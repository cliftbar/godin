## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Four was 
located near latitude 22.0 North, longitude 80.7 West. The 
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 16 mph (26 
km/h). A turn toward the northwest is forecast today, followed by a 
northward motion on Sunday and then a slower northeastward motion  
Sunday night and Monday. On the forecast track, the center of the 
depression will move across western Cuba this morning, and then move 
over the eastern Gulf of Mexico later today and Sunday, reaching the 
Florida Gulf coast late Sunday or Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and the
depression is expected to become a tropical storm later today and
continue strengthening over the eastern Gulf of Mexico through the
weekend.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1009 mb (29.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for the depression can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area
by Sunday night, with tropical storm conditions possible by Sunday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread northward over the
warning areas beginning later today and continuing through Sunday.
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in the
Florida Keys later today or tonight, and in the Florida Panhandle
by late Sunday.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Chassahowitzka, FL to Aucilla River, FL...3-5 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...2-4 ft
Tampa Bay...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Four is expected to produce rainfall
totals of 5 to 10 inches, with maximum rainfall totals up to 15
inches, across portions of Florida and along the Southeast U.S.
coast this weekend through Thursday morning. This rainfall may
result in areas of locally considerable flash and urban flooding,
with isolated river flooding possible.
 
For Cuba, rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches, with localized higher
amounts, will be possible through today. This may result in isolated
to scattered areas of flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Depression Four, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf
 
TORNADOES: A tornado or two is possible across the Florida Keys and
the western Florida Peninsula tonight through Sunday morning.

SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are expected to affect 
much of the Gulf coast of Florida tonight through Monday and along 
the Southeast U.S. coast early next week. These swells are likely 
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
