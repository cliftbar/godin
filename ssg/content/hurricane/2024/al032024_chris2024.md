## Official Advisory Discussion
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Chris was
located near latitude 20.1 North, longitude 97.2 West. Chris is
moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general
motion is expected during the next day or so.  On the forecast
track, the center of Chris will continue farther inland over
eastern Mexico through today.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is expected as Chris moves farther inland, and the system
will likely dissipate over the higher terrain later today.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
