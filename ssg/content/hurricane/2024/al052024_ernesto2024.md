## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was
located near latitude 33.3 North, longitude 64.0 West.  Ernesto is
moving toward the north-northeast near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this 
slow motion is expected to continue through tonight.  An 
acceleration toward the north-northeast is forecast to begin on 
Sunday, with a turn toward the northeast and east-northeast 
occurring on Monday and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the
center of Ernesto will slowly move away from Bermuda through 
tonight and pass near southeastern Newfoundland late Monday and 
Monday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  No significant change in strength is forecast during the 
next 48 hours, and Ernesto should remain near or at hurricane 
strength through Monday.  The cyclone will likely become 
post-tropical near southeastern Newfoundland by Monday night or 
Tuesday morning.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles
(370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 976 mb (28.82 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are likely to continue on Bermuda
through tonight, with hurricane-force gusts possible in rainbands.
 
STORM SURGE:  Coastal flooding is still possible on Bermuda in areas
of onshore winds.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Ernesto is expected to produce an additional 1 to 2
inches (25 to 50 mm) of rainfall through tonight across Bermuda,
with storm total amounts of 7 to 9 inches (175 to 225 mm). This 
rainfall will likely result in considerable life-threatening flash 
flooding to the island, especially in low-lying areas.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the
Bahamas, Bermuda, the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic
Canada today.  Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are
likely in these areas during the next couple of days.  Please
consult products from your local weather office, and stay out of the
water if advised by lifeguards.
