## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ernesto was 
located near latitude 36.1 North, longitude 62.5 West. Ernesto is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h) and some 
increase in forward speed is forecast today, followed by a turn 
toward the northeast and east-northeast on Monday and Tuesday. On 
the forecast track, the center of Ernesto will pass near 
southeastern Newfoundland late Monday into Tuesday morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Some strengthening is possible today and Ernesto is forecast 
to regain hurricane status. The cyclone is forecast to become 
post-tropical after it passes by southeastern Newfoundland by 
Tuesday morning. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 978 mb (28.88 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the 
Bahamas, Bermuda, the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic 
Canada.  Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are likely 
in these areas during the next couple of days.  In southeastern 
Newfoundland large breaking waves could bring the possibility of 
coastal flooding, particularly along southwest-facing shorelines 
from Burin east to Avalon regions.  Please consult products from 
your local weather office, and stay out of the water if advised by 
lifeguards.
