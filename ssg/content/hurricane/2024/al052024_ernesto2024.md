## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ernesto was 
located near latitude 18.8 North, longitude 65.3 West. Ernesto is 
moving toward the northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h). A turn toward the 
north-northwest and north with a gradual decrease in forward speed 
is expected on Wednesday night and Thursday. On the forecast track, 
the center of Ernesto will pass to the northeast and north of Puerto 
Rico through early Wednesday. Ernesto should then move over the 
western Atlantic later in the week and approach Bermuda on Friday 
and Friday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next several days, and 
Ernesto is expected to become a hurricane by early Wednesday to the 
north of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center. Henry E. Rohlsen Airport in St. Croix recently 
reported a sustained wind of 36 mph (57 km/h) and a gust of 58 mph 
(93 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).

from San Juan to Guayama, including the islands of Culebra and
Vieques and in the U.S. Virgin Islands, including St. Thomas, St.
