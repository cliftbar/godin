## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ernesto was 
located near latitude 34.6 North, longitude 63.0 West. Ernesto is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 9 mph (15 km/h),  and some 
increase in forward speed is forecast later today, followed by a 
turn toward the northeast and east-northeast on Monday and Tuesday. 
On the forecast track, the center of Ernesto will pass near 
southeastern Newfoundland late Monday and Monday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Some re-intensification is possible later today, and Ernesto 
could regain hurricane status.  The cyclone will likely become 
post-tropical near southeastern Newfoundland by Monday night or 
Tuesday morning.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 978 mb (28.88 inches).
