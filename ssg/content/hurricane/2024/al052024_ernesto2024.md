## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ernesto was
located near latitude 19.5 North, longitude 66.6 West. Ernesto is
moving toward the northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h).  A turn toward
the north-northwest and north with a gradual decrease in forward
speed is expected tonight and Thursday. On the forecast track, the
center of Ernesto will pass to the north of Puerto Rico through
today. Ernesto should then move over the western Atlantic later in
the week and be nearing Bermuda on Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Ernesto is expected to become a hurricane later this
morning and could become a major hurricane in a couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km) 
from the center. A metar station at the Roosevelt Roads Naval 
Station (TJNR) recently reported a sustained wind of 48 mph (78 
km/h) and a gust of 74 mph (119 km/h).  A NOAA Saildrone located 
about 65 miles north- northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico, recently 
reported a sustained wind of 61 mph (98 km/h) with a gust to 76 mph 
(122 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
