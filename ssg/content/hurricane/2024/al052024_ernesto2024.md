## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ernesto was
located near latitude 16.9 North, longitude 62.6 West.  Ernesto is
moving toward the west-northwest near 18 mph (30 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue through tonight.  A motion 
toward the northwest and then north at a slower forward speed is 
expected on Wednesday and Thursday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Ernesto should pass near or over the Virgin Islands this 
evening, and then pass just to the northeast and north of Puerto 
Rico tonight and on Wednesday.  Ernesto should then move over the 
western Atlantic later in the week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast, and 
Ernesto is expected to become a hurricane by early Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.  A wind gust to 65 mph (105 km/h) was recently 
reported on St. Barthelemy.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
