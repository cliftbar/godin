## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was
located near latitude 40.2 North, longitude 60.5 West.  Ernesto is
moving toward the north-northeast near 21 mph (33 km/h), and a turn 
toward the northeast and east-northeast with an increase in forward 
speed is expected today and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Ernesto will pass near southeastern Newfoundland tonight 
and early Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast today, 
and a weakening trend is expected to begin tonight.  Ernesto is 
expected to lose tropical characteristics during the next day or so.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles
(350 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the
Bahamas, Bermuda, the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic
Canada.  Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are likely
to continue in these areas during the next couple of days.  In
southeastern Newfoundland large breaking waves could bring the
possibility of coastal flooding, particularly along southwest-facing
shorelines from Burin east to Avalon regions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office, and stay out of the water
if advised by lifeguards.
