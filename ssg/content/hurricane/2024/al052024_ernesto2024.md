## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was
located near latitude 41.8 North, longitude 58.5 West. Ernesto is
moving toward the northeast near 28 mph (44 km/h). A turn
toward the northeast and east-northeast with an increase in forward
speed is expected during the next couple of days.  On the forecast
track, the center of Ernesto will pass near southeastern
Newfoundland tonight and early Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Weakening is forecast, and Ernesto is expected
to become a post-tropical cyclone by early Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles
(350 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 968 mb (28.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting Bermuda, the
northeast coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada.
Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are likely to
continue in these areas during the next day or so.  In southeastern
Newfoundland large breaking waves could bring the possibility of
coastal flooding, particularly along southwest-facing shorelines
from Burin east to Avalon regions.  Please consult products from
your local weather office, and stay out of the water if advised by
lifeguards.
