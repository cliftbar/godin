## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beryl was
located near latitude 10.0 North, longitude 47.8 West. Beryl is
moving toward the west near 23 mph (37 km/h).  A relatively
quick westward to west-northwestward motion is expected during the 
next few days.  On the forecast track, the system is expected to 
move across the Windward Islands late Sunday night and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Rapid strengthening is now forecast, and Beryl 
is expected to become a major hurricane before it reaches the 
Windward Islands.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
