## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beryl was
located near latitude 9.3 North, longitude 43.6 West. Beryl is
moving toward the west near 18 mph (30 km/h). A relatively
quick westward to west-northwestward motion is expected during the
next few days.  On the forecast track, the system is expected to
move across the Windward Islands late Sunday night and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Steady strengthening is forecast, and Beryl is 
expected to become a hurricane in a couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
