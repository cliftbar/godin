## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Beryl was located 
near latitude 14.6 North, longitude 66.9 West. Beryl is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 22 mph (35 km/h) and is forecast to 
continue moving rapidly west-northwestward during the next couple of 
days and turn westward by Thursday. On the forecast track, the 
center of Beryl will move quickly across the southeastern and 
central Caribbean Sea today and is forecast to pass near Jamaica on 
Wednesday and the Cayman Islands on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 165 mph (270 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Beryl is a category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Weakening should begin later today, but Beryl 
is still expected to be near major hurricane intensity as its moves 
into the central Caribbean and passes near Jamaica on Wednesday 
and the Cayman Islands on Thursday.  Additional weakening is 
expected thereafter, though Beryl is forecast to remain a hurricane 
in the northwestern Caribbean.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 935 mb (27.61 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast on 
Jamaica within the warning area on Wednesday.  Winds are expected to 
first reach tropical storm strength early on Wednesday, making 
outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area along the
south coast of Hispaniola later today.

Hurricane conditions could begin on Thursday across the Cayman 
Islands.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3
to 5 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along
the immediate coast of Jamaica.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
ground level in areas of onshore winds along the southern coast of
Hispaniola.
 
RAINFALL:  Hurricane Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of
4 to 8 inches, with localized maxima of 12 inches, across Jamaica on
Wednesday. This rainfall is likely to cause flash flooding. Rainfall
from outer bands of Beryl should impact mainly southern portions of
Hispaniola today into Wednesday, with 2 to 6 inches of rain
possible.

SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl will continue across the
Windward and southern Leeward Islands during the next couple of
days. Swells are also expected to reach the southern coasts of
Puerto Rico and Hispaniola later today. These swells are expected to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
