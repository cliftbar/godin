## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 19.0 North, longitude 82.6 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west-northwest near 18 mph (30 km/h). A westward to west-
northwestward motion is expected during the next day or two, taking
the core of Beryl away from the Cayman Islands through this 
afternoon and over the Yucatan Peninsula early Friday. Beryl is 
expected to emerge over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico Friday 
night and move northwestward across the southwestern Gulf of 
Mexico on Saturday.
 
Reports from Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds are now near 115 mph      
(185 km/h) with higher gusts.  Beryl is a category 3 hurricane on 
the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Weakening is forecast 
during the next day or two, though Beryl is forecast to remain a 
hurricane until it makes landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunter data is 971 mb (28.68 inches).

Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area on
the Yucatan Peninsula tonight or early Friday.  Winds are expected
to first reach tropical storm strength later today, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area along
the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula as early as tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area of the Yucatan Peninsula late today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch
area along portions of the coast of Belize by tonight or early
Friday.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2
to 4 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along
the immediate coast of the Cayman Islands.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5 feet
above ground level in areas of onshore winds along the east coast of
the Yucatan Peninsula within the hurricane warning area and by as
much as 1 to 3 feet above ground level along the west coast of the
Yucatan Peninsula in the tropical storm warning area.
 
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 6
inches over the Cayman Islands today. Over the Yucatan Peninsula,
Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 6 inches, with

portions of the coast of Jamaica, Cuba, and the Cayman Islands.
These swells are expected to spread to the Yucatan Peninsula and
portions of Central America later today and to eastern Mexico and
much of the Gulf Coast of the U.S. by late Friday. These swells are
expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
