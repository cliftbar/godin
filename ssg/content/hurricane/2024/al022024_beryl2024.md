## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beryl was
located near latitude 23.0 North, longitude 92.3 West. Beryl is
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). A turn to
the northwest is expected later today, followed by a turn toward
the north-northwest by Sunday night. On the forecast track, the
center of Beryl is expected to approach the Texas coast by late
Sunday into Monday morning.
 
Reports from NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft
indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h)
with higher gusts. Little change in strength is expected today.
However, strengthening is expected to begin tonight or on Sunday,
and Beryl is forecast to become a hurricane before it reaches the
Texas coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from the Hurricane Hunter
aircraft data is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the NHC website at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area
along in Texas by early Monday, with tropical storm conditions 
beginning Sunday night.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm
warning area in Texas and northeastern Mexico late Sunday or 
Sunday night.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Baffin Bay, TX to San Luis Pass, TX...3-5 ft
Corpus Christi Bay...3-5 ft
Matagorda Bay...3-5 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Baffin Bay, TX...2-4 ft
San Luis Pass, TX to High Island, TX...2-4 ft
Galveston Bay...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL:  Heavy rainfall of 5 to 10 inches with localized amounts
of 15 inches is expected across portions of the Texas Gulf Coast and
eastern Texas beginning late Sunday through the middle of next week. 
This rainfall will likely produce areas of flash and urban 
flooding, some of which may be locally considerable. Minor to 
isolated moderate river flooding is also possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Beryl, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?ero
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are expected to reach 
eastern Mexico and much of the Gulf Coast of the U.S. today. 
These swells are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather 
office.
