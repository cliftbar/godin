## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 10.1 North, longitude 49.3 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west near 22 mph (35 km/h). A relatively quick
westward to west-northwestward motion is expected during the next
few days.  On the forecast track, the center of Beryl is expected 
to move across the Windward Islands late Sunday night and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Continued steady to rapid strengthening is 
forecast, and Beryl is expected to become a dangerous major 
hurricane before it reaches the Windward Islands.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles
(95 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone 
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning 
area beginning Sunday night.  Hurricane conditions are possible in 
the hurricane watch areas Sunday night or Monday morning. 
Devastating wind damage is expected where the eyewall of Beryl 
moves through portions of the Windward Islands. 

Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains 
are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds 
indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be 
even greater.

Tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch 
areas by Monday morning.  
 
STORM SURGE:  A life-threatening storm surge will raise water levels 
by as much as 5 to 7 feet above normal tide levels in areas of 
onshore flow near where Beryl makes landfall in the hurricane 
warning and watch areas.  Near the coast, the surge will be 
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 3 to 6 
inches across Barbados and the Windward Islands Sunday night into 
Monday. This rainfall may cause flooding in vulnerable areas.

Showers and thunderstorms well north of Beryl may produce 1 to 4
inches of rain over portions of southeastern Puerto Rico Monday
night into Tuesday.
 
Rainfall from Beryl may impact portions of southern Hispaniola
Tuesday into Wednesday, with 2 to 6 inches of rain possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Beryl, please see the National Weather Service 
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Beryl are expected to reach the 
Windward and southern Leeward Islands by late Sunday.  These swells 
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
