## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beryl was
located by NWS radar data near latitude 29.8 North, longitude 95.7 
West. Beryl is moving toward the north-northeast near 13 mph (20 
km/h). A turn toward the northeast with an increase in forward 
speed is expected tonight and Tuesday. On the forecast track, the 
center of Beryl will move over eastern Texas today, then move 
through the Lower Mississippi Valley into the Ohio Valley on 
Tuesday and Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Steady weakening is forecast, and Beryl is expected to 
become a post-tropical cyclone on Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center. Houston Hobby Airport recently reported a wind 
gust of 84 mph (135 km/h), and Bush Intercontinental Airport 
recently reported a wind gust of 83 mph (134 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 984 mb (29.06 inches) 
based on surface observations.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the NHC website at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions with damaging wind gusts will 
continue within the tropical storm warning area for the next 
several hours.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Freeport, TX to High Island, TX...4-6 ft
Galveston Bay...4-6 ft
High Island, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...3-5 ft
Matagorda, TX to Freeport, TX...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?peakSurge.

RAINFALL:  Heavy rainfall of 5 to 10 inches with localized amounts 
of 15 inches is expected across portions of the Upper Texas Coast 
and eastern Texas today into tonight. Considerable flash and urban 
flooding as well as minor to isolated major river flooding is 
expected.

Heavy rainfall of 3 to 5 inches, with locally higher amounts 
possible, is expected across portions of far southeastern Oklahoma, 
Arkansas and southern Missouri tonight into Tuesday. 

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Tropical Storm Beryl, please see the National 
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?ero

For a list of rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated 
this storm, see the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS2 with the 
WMO header ACUS42 KWBC or at the following link:

TORNADOES: Several tornadoes are possible through tonight across 
parts of east Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Beryl are expected to affect eastern
Mexico and much of the northern and western Gulf Coast of the U.S. 
during the next day or so. These swells are expected to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
