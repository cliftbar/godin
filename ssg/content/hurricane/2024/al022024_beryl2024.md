## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 15.9 North, longitude 70.8 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west-northwest near 22 mph (35 km/h), and this general
motion should continue through Wednesday, followed by a turn more
toward the west Wednesday night or Thursday.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Beryl will move quickly across the central 
Caribbean Sea tonight and is forecast to pass near or over Jamaica 
on Wednesday.  The center is expected to pass near or over the 
Cayman Islands Wednesday night or early Thursday and approach the 
Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico Thursday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 155 mph (250 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Beryl is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Weakening is forecast during the next day 
or two.  However, Beryl is forecast to be at or near major 
hurricane intensity while it passes near Jamaica on Wednesday and 
the Cayman Islands on Wednesday night. Additional weakening is 
expected thereafter, though Beryl is forecast to remain a hurricane 
in the northwestern Caribbean.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 943 mb (27.85 inches).
