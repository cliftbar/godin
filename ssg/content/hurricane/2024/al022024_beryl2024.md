## Official Advisory Discussion
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beryl was
located near latitude 21.2 North, longitude 89.2 West. Beryl is
moving toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h). A west-
northwestward motion is expected through tonight, with the center 
forecast to emerge over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico during the 
next few hours. A turn toward the northwest is expected on 
Saturday, with the center of Beryl expected to approach the western 
Gulf coast late Sunday and Sunday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (100 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Continued weakening is expected during the
next few hours as Beryl crosses the Yucatan Peninsula.
Re-intensification is expected once the center moves back over the
Gulf of Mexico, and Beryl is forecast to regain hurricane status 
on Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 989 mb (29.21 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the NHC website at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of
the northern Yucatan Peninsula and should spread westward along the
Gulf coast of the peninsula for the next several hours.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area along
the western Gulf coast by late Sunday, and tropical storm
conditions are possible in the watch area on Sunday.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide 
will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by 
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could 
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated 
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Baffin Bay, TX to Sargent, TX...3-5 ft
Corpus Christi Bay...3-5 ft
Matagorda Bay...3-5 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Baffin Bay, TX...2-4 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.

For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?peakSurge.

Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet 
above ground level in areas of onshore winds along the west and 
north coasts of the Yucatan Peninsula in the tropical storm
warning area. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Through today Beryl is expected to produce rainfall
totals of 4 to 6 inches, with localized amounts of 10 inches, across
the Yucatan Peninsula, with scattered instances of flash flooding
anticipated.
 
Heavy rainfall of 5 to 10 inches with localized amounts of 15 inches
is expected across portions of the Texas Gulf Coast and eastern
Texas beginning late Sunday through the middle of next week.  This 
rainfall is expected to produce areas of flash and urban flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Beryl, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?ero
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are currently impacting
portions of the coast of Cuba, the Cayman Islands, and the
Yucatan Peninsula. The swells are expected to reach eastern Mexico
and much of the Gulf Coast of the U.S. by late today. These swells
are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
