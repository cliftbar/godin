## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 10.7 North, longitude 54.9 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west near 21 mph (33 km/h). A continued quick westward
to west-northwestward motion is expected during the next few days.
On the forecast track, the center of Beryl is expected to move
across the Windward Islands Monday morning and across the
southeastern and central Caribbean Sea late Monday through 
Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 120 mph (195 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Beryl is a category 3 hurricane on 
the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some additional 
strengthening is forecast through tonight, and Beryl is expected to 
become an extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane before it reaches 
the Windward Islands. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on data from the NOAA and Air 
Force Hurricane Hunters is 964 mb (28.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area beginning early Monday morning.  Potentially catastrophic wind 
damage is expected where the eyewall of Beryl moves through portions 
of the Windward Islands, with the highest risk of the core in St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada. 

Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains 
are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds 
indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be 
even greater.
  
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area starting late tonight, making outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
starting late tonight.

STORM SURGE:  A life-threatening storm surge will raise water levels
by as much as 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas of
onshore flow near where the eye makes landfall in the hurricane
warning area.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Hurricane Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 
3 to 6 inches across Barbados and the Windward Islands through 
Monday. Localized maxima of 10 inches is possible, especially in the 
Grenadines. This rainfall may cause flash flooding in vulnerable 
areas.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf 
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are expected across
Windward and southern Leeward Islands during the next couple of
days.  These swells are expected to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
