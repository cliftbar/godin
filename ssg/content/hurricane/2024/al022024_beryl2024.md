## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 13.2 North, longitude 63.2 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west-northwest near 21 mph (33 km/h). The center of Beryl
will continue moving away from the southern Windward Islands 
tonight and move quickly westward to west-northwestward during the 
next few days. On the forecast track, the center of Beryl will move 
across the southeastern and central Caribbean Sea tonight through 
Tuesday and is forecast to pass near Jamaica on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 150 mph (240 km/h) with higher
gusts. Beryl is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Fluctuations in strength are likely during the
next day or so, but Beryl is expected to remain an extremely
dangerous major hurricane as its moves over the eastern Caribbean.
Some weakening is expected in the central Caribbean by midweek,
though Beryl is forecast to remain a hurricane.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles 
(205 km). The Hewanorra International Airport on St. Lucia recently 
reported sustained winds of 47 mph (76 km/h) and a gust of 64 mph 
(104 km/h). 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 944 mb (27.88 inches).

Islands over the next few hours. Tropical storm conditions are 
expected in the warning area along the south coast of Hispaniola by 
late Tuesday.
 
STORM SURGE:  Water levels should recede into the evening over the
southern Windward Islands.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the immediate
coast of Jamaica.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
ground level in areas of onshore winds along the southern coast of

RAINFALL:  Hurricane Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of
3 to 6 inches across the Windward Islands through this evening.
Localized maxima of 10 inches are possible, especially in the
