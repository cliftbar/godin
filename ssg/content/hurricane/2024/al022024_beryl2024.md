## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located 
near latitude 19.6 North, longitude 85.5 West. Beryl is moving 
toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h). A westward to west- 
northwestward motion is expected during the next day or so, with the 
center expected to make landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula Friday 
morning.  Beryl is expected to emerge over the southwestern Gulf of 
Mexico Friday night and move northwestward toward northeastern 
Mexico and southern Texas late in the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 115 mph (185 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Beryl is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in strength 
is expected before landfall.  Rapid weakening is expected while 
Beryl crosses the Yucatan Peninsula, but slow re-intensification is 
expected when Beryl moves over the Gulf of Mexico.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles 
(220 km). NOAA buoy 42056 recently reported a sustained wind of 65 
mph (105 km/h) with a gust to 76 mph (122 km/h). 
 
The minimum central pressure of 964 mb (28.47 inches) is based on 
data from the Air Force Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance aircraft.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area on the Yucatan Peninsula overnight and on Friday.  Winds are
expected to first reach tropical storm strength during the next
few hours, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area along
the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula overnight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area of the Yucatan Peninsula overnight into Friday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch
area along portions of the coast of Belize by early Friday.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 4 to
6 feet above ground level in areas of onshore winds along the east
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula within the hurricane warning area
and by as much as 1 to 3 feet above ground level along the west
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula in the tropical storm warning 
area. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 6
inches, with localized amounts of 10 inches, through Friday
across the Yucatan Peninsula. Scattered instances of flash flooding
are anticipated across the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are currently impacting
portions of the coast of Cuba, the Cayman Islands, and the
Yucatan Peninsula.  The swells are expected to reach eastern Mexico
and much of the Gulf Coast of the U.S. by late Friday. These swells
are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
