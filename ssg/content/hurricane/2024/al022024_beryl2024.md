## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 12.4 North, longitude 61.3 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west-northwest near 20 mph (31 km/h). The eyewall of 
Beryl is moving across the southern Windward Islands. This is 
an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation. Take action 
now to protect your life! Residents in Grenada, the Grenadine 
Islands, and Carriacou Island should not leave their shelter as 
winds will rapidly increase within the eyewall of Beryl. Remain in 
place through the passage of these life-threatening conditions and 
do not venture out in the eye of the storm.

Beryl is expected to move quickly westward to west-northwestward 
during the next few days. On the forecast track, the center of 
Beryl is currently moving across the southern Windward Islands and 
will move across the southeastern and central Caribbean Sea late 
today through Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 140 mph (220 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Beryl is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Fluctuations in strength are likely during 
the next day or so, but Beryl is expected to remain an extremely 
dangerous major hurricane as its core moves through the Windward 
Islands into the eastern Caribbean. Some weakening is expected in 
the central Caribbean by midweek, though Beryl is forecast to remain 
a hurricane.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles 
(205 km). A weather station in Crown Point, Tobago recently reported 
sustained winds of 46 mph (74 km/h) with a gust to 54 mph (87 km/h). 
There have been multiple reports of downed trees, flooded streets, 
power outages and storm surge flooding in the Grenandines, Grenada, 
Barbados, and Tobago.
 
The minimum central pressure based on aircraft data is 956 mb 
(28.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are occurring in the hurricane warning
area. Potentially catastrophic wind damage is expected where the
core of Beryl is moving through portions of the southern Windward
Islands, including Carriacou Island, Grenada, and the Grenadine
Islands.
 
Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains
are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds
indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be
even greater.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in Jamaica by Wednesday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are occurring or imminent in the tropical
storm warning area.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area by
Tuesday afternoon for parts of the southern coast of Hispaniola.
 
STORM SURGE:  A life-threatening storm surge will raise water levels
by as much as 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas of
onshore winds near where the eye makes landfall in the hurricane
warning area. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Hurricane Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of
3 to 6 inches across Barbados and the Windward Islands through this
afternoon. Localized maxima of 10 inches are possible, especially in
the Grenadines, Tobago, and Grenada. This rainfall may cause flash
flooding in vulnerable areas.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are expected across the
Windward and southern Leeward Islands during the next couple of
days. Swells are also expected to reach the southern coasts of
Puerto Rico and Hispaniola in the next day or so. These swells are
expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
