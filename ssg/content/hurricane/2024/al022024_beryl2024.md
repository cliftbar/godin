## Official Advisory Discussion
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beryl was 
located near latitude 22.2 North, longitude 91.3 West. Beryl is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). A turn to 
the northwest is expected later today and then north-northwestward 
by Sunday night. On the forecast track, the center of Beryl is 
expected to approach the Texas coast by late Sunday into Monday 
morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Little change in strength is expected today, but strengthening is 
expected to begin by Sunday, and Beryl is forecast to become a 
hurricane before it reaches the Texas coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the NHC website at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area
along the Gulf coast of northeastern Mexico and Texas by early
Monday, with tropical storm conditions beginning Sunday night.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Baffin Bay, TX to San Luis Pass, TX...3-5 ft
Corpus Christi Bay...3-5 ft
Matagorda Bay...3-5 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Baffin Bay, TX...2-4 ft
San Luis Pass, TX to High Island, TX...2-4 ft
Galveston Bay...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL:  Heavy rainfall of 5 to 10 inches with localized amounts
of 15 inches is expected across portions of the Texas Gulf Coast and
eastern Texas beginning late Sunday through midweek.  This rainfall
is likely to produce areas of flash and urban flooding, some of
which may be locally considerable in nature.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Beryl, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?ero
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are currently impacting
portions of the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula. The swells are
expected to reach eastern Mexico and much of the Gulf Coast of the
U.S. shortly. These swells are expected to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
