## Official Advisory Discussion
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located 
near latitude 20.1 North, longitude 86.9 West. Beryl is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h). A west- 
northwestward motion is expected during the next day or so, with the 
center expected to make landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula in the 
next few hours.  Beryl is expected to emerge over the southwestern 
Gulf of Mexico tonight and then move northwestward toward 
northeastern Mexico and southern Texas by the end of the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Rapid weakening is expected after Beryl moves inland and 
crosses the Yucatan Peninsula, but slow re-intensification is 
expected once Beryl moves back over the Gulf of Mexico.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 971 mb (28.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area on the Yucatan Peninsula later this morning.  Winds are
expected to first reach tropical storm strength shortly, making
outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area along
the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula this morning.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area of the Yucatan Caribbean coast this morning and over the
Yucatan Gulf coast later today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch
area along portions of the coast of Belize this morning.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 4 to
6 feet above ground level in areas of onshore winds along the east
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula within the hurricane warning area
and by as much as 1 to 3 feet above ground level along the west
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula in the tropical storm warning
area. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.

RAINFALL: Through today Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals 
of 4 to 6 inches, with localized amounts of 10 inches, across the 
Yucatan Peninsula, with scattered instances of flash flooding 
anticipated. 

Heavy rainfall of 4 to 8 inches with locally higher amounts is 
expected across portions of northeastern Mexico and South Texas by 
Sunday into the coming week. 

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?ero
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are currently impacting
portions of the coast of Cuba, the Cayman Islands, and the
Yucatan Peninsula.  The swells are expected to reach eastern Mexico
and much of the Gulf Coast of the U.S. by late today. These swells
are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
