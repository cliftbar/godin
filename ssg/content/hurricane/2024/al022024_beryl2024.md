## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 16.6 North, longitude 74.4 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west-northwest near 20 mph (31 km/h), and this general
motion should continue through today, followed by a turn more toward
the west tonight or Thursday.  On the forecast track, the center of
Beryl will move rapidly across the central Caribbean Sea and is
forecast to pass near or over Jamaica later today.  The center is
expected to pass near or over the Cayman Islands tonight or early
Thursday and move over the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico early Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Beryl is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some weakening is forecast during the next 
day or two.  However, Beryl is forecast to be at or near major 
hurricane intensity while it passes near Jamaica later today and 
the Cayman Islands tonight or early Thursday. Additional weakening 
is expected thereafter, though Beryl is forecast to remain a 
hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 946 mb (27.94 inches).

the immediate coast of Jamaica.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the immediate
