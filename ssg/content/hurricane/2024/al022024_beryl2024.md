## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 18.5 North, longitude 81.0 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west-northwest near 20 mph (31 km/h). A westward to west-
northwestward motion is expected during the next day or two, taking
the core of Beryl just south of the Cayman Islands early today and
over the Yucatan Peninsula early Friday. Beryl is expected to emerge
over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico Friday night and turn
northwestward.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 120 mph (195 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Beryl is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Weakening is forecast during 
the next day or two. However, Beryl is forecast to be near major 
hurricane intensity today as it passes by the Cayman Islands. 
Additional weakening is expected thereafter, though Beryl is 
forecast to remain a hurricane until it makes landfall on the 
Yucatan Peninsula.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 968 mb (28.59 inches).

Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the Cayman Islands
soon, with tropical storm conditions ongoing.

Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area on
the Yucatan Peninsula late today or early Friday.  Winds are 
expected to first reach tropical storm strength later today, making
outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area along
the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula as early as late today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area of the Yucatan Peninsula late today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch
area along portions of the coast of Belize by late today or early
Friday.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2
to 4 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along
the immediate coast of the Cayman Islands.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet
above ground level in areas of onshore winds along the east coast of
the Yucatan Peninsula within the hurricane warning area and by as
much as 1 to 3 feet above ground level along the west coast of the
Yucatan Peninsula in the tropical storm warning area.
 
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.

RAINFALL:  Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 6 
inches over the Cayman Islands today. Over the Yucatan Peninsula, 
Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 6 inches, with 
localized amounts of 10 inches, later today into Friday. Scattered 
instances of flash flooding are anticipated. 

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are currently impacting
portions of the coast of Jamaica, Cuba, and the Cayman Islands.
These swells are expected to spread to the Yucatan Peninsula and
portions of Central America later today and to eastern Mexico and
much of the Gulf Coast of the U.S. by late Friday. These swells are
expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
