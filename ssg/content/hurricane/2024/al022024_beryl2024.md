## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 19.5 North, longitude 84.3 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west-northwest near 20 mph (31 km/h). A westward to west-
northwestward motion is expected during the next day or so, with 
the center expected to make landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula of 
Mexico early Friday.  Beryl is expected to emerge over the 
southwestern Gulf of Mexico Friday night and move northwestward 
across the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on Saturday and Saturday 
night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Slow weakening is forecast before the center makes 
landfall, with additional weakening expected while Beryl crosses 
the Yucatan Peninsula.  Slow re-intensification is expected when 
Beryl moves over the Gulf of Mexico.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 974 mb (28.77 inches).

the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula as early as tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area of the Yucatan Peninsula tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch
area along portions of the coast of Belize by tonight or early
Friday.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 to
5 feet above ground level in areas of onshore winds along the east
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula within the hurricane warning area
and by as much as 1 to 3 feet above ground level along the west
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula in the tropical storm warning area.
 
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 6
