## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beryl was 
located near latitude 24.7 North, longitude 94.0 West. Beryl is 
moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h) and this motion 
should continue through Sunday.  A turn toward the north-northwest 
is expected Sunday night, with a turn toward the north on Monday. On 
the forecast track, the center of Beryl is expected to make landfall 
on the Texas coast Monday morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts. Strengthening is expected, and Beryl is forecast to become a
hurricane again Sunday or Sunday night before it reaches the Texas
coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center. NOAA buoy 42002 in the western Gulf of Mexico 
recently reported a sustained wind of 42 mph (68 km/h) and a gust 
of 54 mph (86 km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure based on observations from the NOAA
and Air Force reconnaissance aircraft is 993 mb (29.33 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the NHC website at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning 
area by early Monday.  Winds are first expected to reach tropical 
storm strength by late Sunday, making outdoor preparations difficult 
or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch areas by
early Monday, with tropical storm conditions beginning by Sunday
night.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm
warning areas in Texas and northeastern Mexico by Sunday night.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Mesquite Bay, TX to Freeport, TX...4-6 ft
Matagorda Bay...4-6 ft
Freeport, TX to High Island, TX...3-5 ft
N Entrance Padre Island NS, TX to Mesquite Bay, TX...3-5 ft
Corpus Christi Bay...3-5 ft
Galveston Bay...3-5 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to N Entrance Padre Island NS, TX...2-4 
ft
High Island, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft
Sabine Pass, TX to Cameron, LA...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL:  Heavy rainfall of 5 to 10 inches with localized amounts
of 15 inches is expected across portions of the Texas Gulf Coast and
eastern Texas beginning late Sunday through midweek.  This rainfall
will produce areas of flash and urban flooding, some of which may be
locally considerable. Minor to isolated moderate river flooding is
also expected.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Beryl, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?ero
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes could occur along the Texas Coast Sunday
afternoon and Sunday night.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Beryl are expected to affect eastern
Mexico and much of the Gulf Coast of the U.S. during the next few
days.  These swells are expected to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
