## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located
near latitude 23.7 North, longitude 49.4 West. Kirk is moving toward
the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A turn toward the north and
northeast at a faster forward speed is anticipated over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are now near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Kirk is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Small intensity fluctuations are possible 
today and tonight. Weakening is forecast to begin on Saturday and 
continue through early next week.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles
(350 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 943 mb (27.85 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are spreading westward and are
expected to reach the Leeward Islands this evening, Bermuda and the
Greater Antilles on Saturday, the east coast of the United States,
Atlantic Canada, and the Bahamas on Sunday, and the Azores on
Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
