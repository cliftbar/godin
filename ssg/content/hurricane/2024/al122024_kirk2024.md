## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located
near latitude 37.0 North, longitude 46.2 West. Kirk is moving toward
the north-northeast near 23 mph (37 km/h). A turn toward the 
northeast is expected tonight. An acceleration toward the 
east-northeast or east is expected by Monday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Although gradual weakening is expected over the next few 
days and Kirk is expected to become post-tropical on Monday, it will 
remain a large cyclone with a large wind field through the early 
part of this week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 300
miles (480 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 961 mb (28.38 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Bermuda, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, the east coast of the
United States and portions of Atlantic Canada. These swells will
spread to the Azores on Monday. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
