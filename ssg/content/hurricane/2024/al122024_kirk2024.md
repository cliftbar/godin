## Official Advisory Discussion
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located
near latitude 19.3 North, longitude 44.3 West. Kirk is moving toward
the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this general motion is
expected over the day or so with a gradual turn more to the
north-northwest and northward by this weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Kirk is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Strengthening is forecast over the next 
couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles
(350 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 955 mb (28.20 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are beginning to spread outward and
could affect portions of Leeward Islands and Bermuda by this
weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
