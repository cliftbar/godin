## Official Advisory Discussion
At 900 AM GMT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located
near latitude 40.2 North, longitude 41.0 West. Kirk is moving toward
the northeast near 30 mph (48 km/h).  An even faster 
east-northeastward motion is expected during the next couple of 
days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Although gradual weakening is expected, Kirk is forecast to
become a large and strong extratropical low during the next couple
of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310
miles (500 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 966 mb (28.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Bermuda, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, the east coast of the
United States, portions of Atlantic Canada, and the Azores. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
