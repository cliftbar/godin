## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Kirk was
located near latitude 13.5 North, longitude 34.8 West. Kirk is
moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h), and a general 
westward to west-northwestward motion is expected to continue 
through Tuesday. A gradual turn to the northwest is forecast by 
Wednesday.
 
Satellite wind data indicate that the maximum sustained winds have 
increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.  Kirk is 
likely to become a hurricane by tomorrow and could become a major 
hurricane by midweek.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
