## Official Advisory Discussion
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Kirk
was located near latitude 41.7 North, longitude 38.4 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the northeast near 29 mph (46
km/h). An even faster east-northeastward motion is expected during 
the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Although gradual weakening is expected, Kirk is forecast to
remain a large and strong extratropical low during the next couple
of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310
miles (500 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 963 mb (28.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,
the east coast of the United States, portions of Atlantic Canada,
and the Azores. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
