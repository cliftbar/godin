## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ernesto was
located near latitude 16.0 North, longitude 57.5 West. Ernesto is
moving toward the west-northwest near 28 mph (44 km/h). A westward 
to west-northwestward motion with some decrease in forward speed is 
expected during the next couple of days. On the forecast track, 
Ernesto is expected to move across portions of the Leeward Islands 
late tonight or Tuesday and near or over the U.S. and British 
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by Tuesday evening.  Ernesto is then 
forecast to turn northward over the western Atlantic.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Gradual strengthening is expected during the 
next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1009 mb (29.80 inches).

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area
for the Leeward Islands beginning late tonight or early Tuesday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin spreading over the
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by Tuesday evening.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level for the eastern coast of Puerto Rico
from San Juan to Guayama, including the islands of Culebra and
Vieques and in the U.S. Virgin Islands, including St. Thomas, St.
John, and St. Croix.
 
A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet
above normal tide levels in the British Virgin Islands. Near the

portions of the Leeward Islands beginning late tonight.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
