## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Leslie was
located near latitude 29.3 North, longitude 47.9 West. Leslie is
moving toward the northeast near 22 mph (35 km/h) and a 
northeastward to east-northeastward motion with an increase in
forward speed is expected during the next couple of days.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Leslie is expected to pass south of 
the Azores late Sunday or Sunday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is expected through Saturday.  After 
that, Leslie is likely to weaken and become extratropical Saturday

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
mainly to the southeast of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
