## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Leslie was
located near latitude 10.4 North, longitude 30.1 West. Leslie is
moving toward the west near 6 mph (9 km/h).  A continued slow 
westward to west-northwestward motion is expected during the next 
few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Steady strengthening is forecast, and Leslie is 
expected to become a hurricane in a couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
