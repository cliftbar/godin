## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Leslie was
located near latitude 23.9 North, longitude 50.9 West. Leslie is
moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A turn toward
the north is expected tonight, followed by a turn to the northeast 
on Friday, with an east-northeastward turn expected over the 
weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Rapid weakening is forecast to continue during the next day 
or so, and Leslie is forecast to lose tropical characteristics in a 
few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
