## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Leslie was
located near latitude 20.7 North, longitude 47.0 West. Leslie is
moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). A gradual 
slowdown and turn northward and then north-northeastward is 
anticipated over the next few days. 
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Some additional strengthening is forecast over 
the next day or so, followed by rapid weakening by Friday. 

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).
