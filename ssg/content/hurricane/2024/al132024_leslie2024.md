## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Leslie was
located near latitude 26.4 North, longitude 50.5 West. Leslie is
moving toward the north-northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h). A turn
toward the northeast with an increase in forward speed is expected
tonight, followed by a turn toward the east-northeast over the
weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h)
with higher gusts. Gradual weakening is expected to continue today,
and Leslie is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone in a day
or two.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
