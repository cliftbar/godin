## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Joyce was 
located near latitude 18.6 North, longitude 44.0 West. Joyce is 
moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). A west-northwest 
to northwest motion is expected during the next couple of days, 
followed by a gradual turn toward the north early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Some additional strengthening is possible through 
early Saturday, followed by gradual weakening through early next 
week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center in the northern semicircle.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
