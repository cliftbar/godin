## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Joyce was
located near latitude 20.9 North, longitude 47.5 West.  Joyce is
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general 
motion with a decrease in forward speed is expected through late 
Sunday.  A turn toward the north and north-northeast is forecast on 
Monday and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast, and Joyce is expected to become a depression 
by early Monday and then a remnant low by early Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
