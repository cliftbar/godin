## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Joyce was
located near latitude 21.3 North, longitude 48.1 West.  Joyce is
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general
motion with a decrease in forward speed is expected through tonight. 
A turn toward the north and north-northeast is forecast on Monday 
and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Weakening is forecast, and Joyce is expected to become a 
depression by early Monday and then a remnant low on Tuesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
