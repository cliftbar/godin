## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Joyce was
located near latitude 20.3 North, longitude 46.7 West. Joyce is
moving toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and a
west-northwestward to northwestward motion with a decrease in
forward speed is expected through Sunday.  A slow turn toward the
north-northwest and north is forecast Sunday night and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Joyce is forecast to gradually weaken, and could 
degenerate into a remnant low by early Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
