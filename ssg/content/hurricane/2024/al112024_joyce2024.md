## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Joyce was
located near latitude 21.6 North, longitude 48.5 West. Joyce is
moving toward the northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue today with a turn toward the north
anticipated on Monday and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Joyce is likely to start weakening later today and could become a
tropical depression on Monday and a remnant low on Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
