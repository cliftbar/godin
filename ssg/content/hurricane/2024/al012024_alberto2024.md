## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Alberto
was located near latitude 22.3 North, longitude 99.4 West. The
depression is moving toward the west near 18 mph (30 km/h), and this
motion is expected to continue through today, as Alberto moves
farther inland over Mexico.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Alberto is expected to continue weakening as it moves inland, and
the system is likely to dissipate over Mexico later today.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Alberto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall associated with Tropical Depression Alberto is
expected to begin to diminish across southern Texas today, with
additional rainfall totals generally 1 inch or less. Heavy rainfall
will continue to impact northeast Mexico today, with rainfall totals
of 5 to 10 inches expected.  Maximum rainfall totals around 20
inches are possible across the higher terrain of the Mexican states
of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Depression Alberto, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and
the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded
by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Sargent, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft
Galveston Bay...2-4 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Sargent, TX...1-3 ft
Sabine Pass, TX to Vermilion/Cameron Parish Line, LA...1-3 ft
 
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge 
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For 
information specific to your area, please see products issued by 
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast of northeastern
Mexico in areas of onshore winds.  Near the coast, the surge will
be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
WIND:  Gusty winds are possible in portions of southern Texas and
northern Mexico through this evening.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Alberto will affect the coast of Texas
and northeastern Mexico through Friday.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
