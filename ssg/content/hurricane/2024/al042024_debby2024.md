## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Debby was
located near latitude 27.7 North, longitude 84.4 West.  Debby is
moving toward the north near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A gradual decrease 
in forward speed with a turn toward the northeast and east is 
expected on Monday and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center 
will move across the northeastern Gulf of Mexico through tonight and 
reach the Florida Big Bend coast around midday Monday.  Debby is 
then expected to move slowly across northern Florida and southern 
Georgia Monday and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Rapid strengthening is forecast, and Debby is expected to
become a hurricane tonight, with additional strengthening likely 
before it reaches the Florida Big Bend coast on Monday.  Weakening 
is expected on Monday and Tuesday after Debby moves inland.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning 
area and possible in the hurricane watch area early Monday, with 
tropical storm conditions expected to arrive this evening. Tropical 
storm conditions are expected to spread northward over the tropical 
storm warning area along the Gulf coast through tonight, and begin 
along portions of the tropical storm warning area along the Atlantic 
coast by late Monday. Tropical storm conditions are possible along 
the coast of South Carolina within the tropical storm watch area 
late Monday night.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Suwannee River to Ochlockonee River, FL...6-10 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Suwannee River, FL...5-8 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Indian Pass, FL...4-6 ft
Tampa Bay...3-5 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Yankeetown, FL...3-5 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...2-4 ft
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to South Santee River, SC...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce rainfall totals of 6 to 12 
inches, with maximum amounts of 18 inches, across portions of 
northern Florida and southeastern North Carolina through Friday 
morning.  This rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable 
flash and urban flooding, with significant river flooding expected. 

Across portions of southeast Georgia and South Carolina, 10 to 20 
inches of rainfall, with local amounts to 30 inches, are expected 
through Friday morning.  This potentially historic rainfall will 
likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding.

For western Cuba, additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches, with 
localized higher amounts, will be possible through today. This will 
result in isolated to scattered areas of flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Debby, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible over central and northern
Florida and southern Georgia tonight and Monday.  The threat will
spread northeastward into coastal Georgia and parts of South
Carolina on Monday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the
Gulf coast of Florida through Monday.  Swells will begin to affect
the Southeast U.S. coast on Monday and continue through the middle
of the week. These conditions are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
