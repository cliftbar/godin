HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Wind gusts to tropical-storm-force could occur for a few more
hours along portions of the North Carolina coast.
 
STORM SURGE: Coastal flooding is possible in the Cape Fear, Neuse, 
and Pamlico Rivers...1 to 3 ft.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce an additional 3 to 6 inches 
of rainfall with locally higher amounts, across portions of 
southeastern North Carolina leading to maximum storm total amounts 
as high as 15 inches.  Additional rainfall of 1 to 3 inches over 
portions of eastern South Carolina will bring maximum storm total 
amounts as high as 20 to 25 inches. Considerable flooding is 
expected across portions of eastern South Carolina and southeast 
North Carolina through Friday.

From central North Carolina northward across portions of Virginia, 3 
to 7 inches with local amounts to 10 inches, are expected through 
Friday. This rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable to 
locally catastrophic flash and urban flooding, especially in the 
terrain of western Virginia, with river flooding also possible.

From portions of Maryland north through Upstate New York and 
Vermont, 2 to 4 inches, with local amounts to 6 inches, are expected 
through Friday night. This will likely result in areas of 
considerable flash and urban flooding as well as river flooding.

For the remainder of northern New England, 1 to 3 inches, with 
local amounts to 4 inches, are expected into Saturday.  Scattered 
instances of flash flooding are possible.

associated with  Debby, please see the National Weather Service 
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at

The threat for tornadoes will shift northward into parts of New 
Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania on Friday.

coast for another day or so. These conditions are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
