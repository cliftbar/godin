Some slight weakening is forecast tonight or early Tuesday.  Some 
re-strengthening is possible on Wednesday and Thursday when Debby 
is off the southeastern U.S. coast.

from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
tropical storm warning area along the Florida and Georgia Atlantic
coast through early Tuesday.  Tropical storm conditions are 
expected along the coast of South Carolina within the tropical 
storm warning area by late tonight or early Tuesday.  Tropical 
storm conditions are possible within the tropical storm watch area 
in North Carolina beginning Wednesday night.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to Cape Fear, NC...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce potentially historic 
rainfall totals of 10 to 20 inches, with maximum amounts of 30 
inches, bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of 
eastern Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina, and southeast 
North Carolina through Wednesday.  Across portions of central and 
northeast North Carolina, 6 to 12 inches of rainfall, with local 
amounts to 18 inches, are expected through Saturday morning. This 
rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable flash and urban 
flooding, with significant river flooding expected.  

An additional scattered 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, with maximum 
amounts of 4 inches is possible across western portions of the 
Central Florida Peninsula which may aggravate any ongoing flooding 
conditions across that area.  
  
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with  Debby, please see the National Weather Service 
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.  For a list of 
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see 
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the WMO header ACUS44 
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html. 
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible over southeastern Georgia 
and coastal South Carolina tonight through Tuesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the
Gulf coast of Florida through tonight.  Swells will continue to
affect the Southeast U.S. coast through the middle of the week.
These conditions are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
