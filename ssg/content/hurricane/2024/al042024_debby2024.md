## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Debby was 
located near latitude 25.5 North, longitude 84.0 West. Debby is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). A turn 
toward the north is expected later today, followed by a slower 
motion toward the northeast on Monday and Tuesday.  On the forecast 
track, the center will move across the eastern Gulf of Mexico 
through tonight and reach the Florida Big Bend coast Monday morning. 
Debby is then expected to move slowly across northern Florida and 
southern Georgia Monday and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Continued strengthening is forecast, and Debby 
is expected to become a hurricane by tonight before it reaches the 
Florida Big Bend coast. Weakening is expected on Monday and Tuesday 
after Debby moves inland.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.  A wind gust of 47 mph (76 km/h) was recently 
reported at the Key West Naval Air Station in the Florida Keys.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface 
observations is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area and possible in the hurricane watch areas early Monday, with
tropical storm conditions expected to arrive this evening.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread northward over the
tropical storm warning areas through tonight. Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the watch area in the Florida Keys
during the next several hours, and in the Florida Panhandle on
Monday.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Suwannee River to Aucilla River, FL to, FL...6-10 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Suwannee River, FL...4-7 ft
Aucilla River, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...4-6 ft
Aripeka, FL to Yankeetown, FL...3-5 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Indian Pass, FL...3-5 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Aripeka, FL...2-4 ft
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to Altamaha Sound, GA...2-4 ft
Tampa Bay...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Debby is expected to produce rainfall
totals of 6 to 12 inches, with maximum amounts of 18 inches, across
portions of northern Florida through Friday morning.  This rainfall
will likely result in areas of considerable flash and urban
flooding, with significant river flooding expected.
 
Across portions of southeast Georgia and South Carolina, 10 to 20
inches of rainfall, with local amounts to 30 inches, are expected
through Friday morning.  This potentially historic rainfall will
likely result in areas of severe and widespread flash and urban
flooding, with significant river flooding expected.
 
For Cuba, additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches, with
localized higher amounts, will be possible through Sunday morning.
This will result in isolated to scattered areas of flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Debby, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible through Monday morning,
mainly over western and northern Florida and southern Georgia.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the
Gulf coast of Florida through Monday.  Swells will begin to affect
the Southeast U.S. coast on Monday and continue through the middle
of the week. These conditions are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
