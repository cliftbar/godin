## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Debby was located
near latitude 28.6 North, longitude 84.0 West. Debby is moving
toward the north near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A gradual decrease
in forward speed with a turn toward the northeast and east is
expected on Monday and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center
will move across the northeastern Gulf of Mexico tonight and
reach the Florida Big Bend coast Monday morning.  Debby is
then expected to move slowly across northern Florida and southern
Georgia Monday and Tuesday, and be near the Georgia coast by  
Tuesday night.
 
Data from Air Force and NOAA reconnaissance aircraft indicate that 
maximum sustained winds have increased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is likely before 
Debby reaches the Florida Big Bend coast on Monday.  Weakening is 
expected on Monday and Tuesday after Debby moves inland.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from reconnaissance 
aircraft data is 985 mb (29.09 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area by early Monday, with tropical storm conditions beginning 
overnight. Tropical storm conditions will continue to spread 
northward over the tropical storm warning area along the Florida 
Gulf coast through tonight, and begin along portions of the
tropical storm warning area along the Atlantic coast by late
Monday. Tropical storm conditions are expected along the coast of
South Carolina within the tropical storm warning area late 
Monday night.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Yankeetown, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...6-10 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Yankeetown, FL...4-6 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Indian Pass, FL...4-6 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...3-5 ft
Tampa Bay...3-5 ft
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to South Santee River, SC...2-4 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...2-4 ft

For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Debby is expected to produce rainfall 
totals of 6 to 12 inches, with maximum amounts of 18 inches, across 
portions of central and northern Florida and southeastern North 
Carolina through Friday morning.  This rainfall will likely result 
in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with significant 
river flooding expected. 

Across portions of southeast Georgia and South Carolina, 10 to 20 
inches of rainfall, with local amounts to 30 inches, are expected 
through Friday morning.  This potentially historic rainfall will 
likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Tropical Storm Debby, please see the National 
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.  For a list of 
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see 
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the WMO header ACUS44 
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible over central and northern
Florida and southern Georgia tonight and Monday.  The threat will
spread northeastward into coastal Georgia and parts of South
Carolina on Monday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the
Gulf coast of Florida through Monday.  Swells will begin to affect
the Southeast U.S. coast on Monday and continue through the middle
of the week. These conditions are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
