## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Debby was
located near latitude 24.4 North, longitude 83.6 West.  Debby is
moving toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A turn toward 
the north is expected on Sunday, followed by a slower motion toward 
the northeast on Monday and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the 
center will move across the eastern Gulf of Mexico through Sunday 
night and reach the Florida Big Bend coast Monday morning.  The 
center is then expected to move slowly across northern Florida and 
southern Georgia Monday and Tuesday.
 
Data from NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds have increased to near 45 mph 
(75 km/h) with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast, 
and Debby is expected to become a hurricane by Sunday night, before 
it reaches the Florida Big Bend coast.  Weakening is expected on 
Monday and Tuesday after Debby moves inland. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.  Wind gusts to 49 mph (80 km/h) and 48 mph (78 
km/h) were recently reported at the Key West Naval Air Station and 
Key West International Airport, respectively.
 
The minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data is 1003 mb 
(29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area and possible in the hurricane watch areas on Monday, with
tropical storm conditions expected to arrive Sunday night.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread northward over the
tropical storm warning areas tonight through Sunday. Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the watch area in the Florida Keys
tonight, and in the Florida Panhandle on Monday.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Suwannee River to Aucilla River, FL...6-10 ft
Yankeetown to Suwannee River, FL ...4-7 ft
Aucilla River to Ochlockonee River, FL...4-6 ft
Aripeka to Yankeetown, FL...3-5 ft
Ochlockonee River to Indian Pass, FL...3-5 ft
Bonita Beach to Aripeka, FL...2-4 ft
Tampa Bay...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Debby is expected to produce rainfall
totals of 6 to 12 inches, with maximum rainfall totals up to 18
inches, across portions of Florida and along the Southeast U.S.
coast this weekend through Thursday. This rainfall will likely
result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with
significant river flooding expected.
 
For Cuba, rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches, with localized higher
amounts, will be possible through tonight. This will result in
isolated to scattered areas of flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Debby, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero
 
TORNADOES: A tornado or two is possible across the Florida Keys and 
the southern and western parts of the Florida Peninsula through 
tonight, expanding across much of northern and central Florida on 
Sunday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the
Gulf coast of Florida tonight through Monday and along the Southeast
U.S. coast early next week. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
