## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Francine was
located near latitude 28.0 North, longitude 92.7 West. Francine is
moving toward the northeast near 13 mph (20 km/h). A faster
northeastward motion is expected this afternoon, and Francine is
anticipated to make landfall in Louisiana within the warning area
late this afternoon or this evening. After landfall, the center is
expected to cross southeastern Louisiana tonight, then move
northward across Mississippi on Thursday and Thursday night.
 
Reports from Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is expected before 
landfall. Francine is expected to rapidly weaken after landfall, and 
the system is forecast to become post-tropical on Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km). An oil platform north of the center recently reported
sustained winds of 87 mph (141 km/h) and a peak gust of 105 mph  
(169 km/h) at an elevation of 98 ft (30 m).
 
The minimum central pressure based on the Hurricane Hunter
aircraft data is 976 mb (28.82 inches).  An oil platform located 
east of the center recently reported a pressure of 978.7 mb (28.90 
inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Francine can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header
WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area this afternoon and tonight, with tropical storm
conditions arriving in the warning area during the next several
hours. Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch
area this afternoon and tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area along the
coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama this afternoon and
tonight.
 
RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4 to 
8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches across southeastern 
Louisiana, Mississippi, far southern Alabama and the Florida 
Panhandle through Thursday night. This rainfall could lead to 
considerable flash, urban and river flooding.   

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total 
Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.  For a list of 
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see 
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS1 with the WMO header ACUS41 
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html. 

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Intracoastal City, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-10 ft
Vermilion Bay...5-10 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-7 ft
Mouth of the Pearl River, LA to Ocean Springs, MS...4-6 ft
Lake Pontchartrain...4-6 ft
Ocean Springs, MS to MS/AL Border...3-5 ft
Cameron, LA to Intracoastal City, LA...3-5 ft
Lake Maurepas...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees.  However,
there may be some overtopping of local levees.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible today and tonight across
parts of southeast Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern
Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine are affecting much of the
northern and northwestern Gulf Coast, likely causing
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
