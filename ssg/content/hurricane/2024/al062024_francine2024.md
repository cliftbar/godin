## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Francine was
located near latitude 30.2 North, longitude 90.6 West. Francine is
moving toward the northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h).  A slower 
north-northeastward motion is expected during the next couple of 
days.

Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Rapid weakening is forecast, and Francine is expected to 
become a tropical depression by late Thursday and a post-tropical 
cyclone Thursday night or early Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.  Gusts to hurricane-force have been occurring in 
the New Orleans area.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 982 mb (29.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Francine can be found in the Tropical Cyclone 
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue in
portions of the warning area through early Thursday.
 
RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4 to
8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches across southeastern
Louisiana, Mississippi, far southern Alabama, and the Florida
Panhandle through Thursday night. This rainfall could lead to
considerable flash, urban and river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.  For a list of
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS1 with the WMO header ACUS41
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Burns Point, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-8 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-6 ft
Mouth of the Pearl River, LA to Ocean Springs, MS...4-6 ft
Lake Pontchartrain...4-6 ft
Ocean Springs, MS to MS/AL Border...3-5 ft
Intracoastal City, LA to Burns Point, LA...3-5 ft
Lake Maurepas...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees.  However,
there may be some overtopping of local levees.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible overnight across
parts of southeast Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern
Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle. On Thursday, the tornado risk
will move into additional parts of Alabama, southwest Georgia and
the Florida Panhandle.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine are affecting much of the
northern Gulf Coast, likely causing life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
