## Official Advisory Discussion
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Francine was
located near latitude 24.4 North, longitude 96.2 West. Francine is
moving toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h).  A slow 
north-northwest motion is expected through this morning,
followed by a turn to the northeast with an increase in forward
speed.  On the forecast track, Francine is anticipated to be just
offshore of the coasts of northeastern Mexico and southern Texas
through today, and make landfall in Louisiana on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Francine will likely become a hurricane today, with
significant strengthening expected before it reaches the coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Francine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO
header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area on Wednesday.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the
hurricane watch area on Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions
expected by Wednesday morning within the warning areas.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in Mexico
and south Texas through this afternoon.  Tropical storm conditions
are possible within the watch area along the northeastern coast
of Mexico for the next several hours.  Tropical storm conditions
are also possible along portions of the Texas coast in the watch
area today and tonight, and are possible in the watch area in
eastern Louisiana on Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4 to 
8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches across much of Louisiana 
and Mississippi through Friday morning.  This rainfall could lead 
to considerable flash and urban flooding. 

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total 
Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Cameron, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-10 ft
Vermilion Bay...5-10 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-7 ft
High Island, TX to Cameron, LA...3-5 ft
Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA to MS/AL Border...2-4 ft
Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas...2-4 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to High Island, TX...1-3 ft
Galveston Bay...1-3 ft
MS/AL Border to AL/FL Border...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees.  However,
there may be some overtopping of local levees.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
Minor coastal flooding is possible along the coast of Mexico in
areas of onshore winds.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible Wednesday morning through 
Wednesday night over near-coastal areas of Louisiana, Mississippi, 
Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine are affecting portions of the
coast of northeastern Mexico and southern Texas.  These swells are
expected to spread across the northwestern and northern Gulf of
Mexico coastline during the next day or so.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
