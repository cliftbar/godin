## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression
Francine was located near latitude 32.5 North, longitude 90.1 West.
The depression is moving toward the north near 14 mph (22 km/h), 
and this general motion is expected to continue with a decrease in 
forward speed through Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Francine will move over central and northern portions of 
Mississippi this afternoon and tonight and move into northeastern 
Arkansas by Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast, and Francine is expected to become a 
post-tropical cyclone later today or tonight.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface observations 
from the Jackson area is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Key messages for Francine can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Wind gusts to tropical-storm force are possible for the next
few hours over portions of central Mississippi and western Alabama.
 
RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4 to 
8 inches across portions of Mississippi, eastern Arkansas, 
Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia and the Florida Panhandle. Localized 
amounts of 12 inches are possible over portions of Alabama, the

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total 
Rainfall Graphic, available at
