## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Francine was
located near latitude 24.3 North, longitude 96.2 West. Francine is
moving toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h).  A continued
slow north-northwest motion is expected through Tuesday morning,
followed by a turn to the northeast with an increase in forward
speed. On the forecast track, Francine is anticipated to be just
offshore of the coasts of northeastern Mexico and southern Texas
through Tuesday, and make landfall in Louisiana on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Francine will likely become a hurricane early Tuesday, with
significant strengthening expected before it reaches the coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure based on data from the NOAA and Air
Force Hurricane Hunters is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Francine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO
header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane 
warning area on Wednesday. Hurricane conditions are possible in the 
hurricane watch area on Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions 
expected by Wednesday morning within the warning areas.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in Mexico
and south Texas through Tuesday afternoon. Tropical storm conditions
are possible within the watch area along the northern coast of
Mexico tonight. Tropical storm conditions are also possible along
portions of the Texas coast in the watch area Tuesday and Tuesday
night, and are possible in the watch area in eastern Louisiana on
Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4 to
8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches, from the coast of far
northeast Mexico northward over the far lower and far upper Texas
coasts, and across much of Louisiana and Mississippi into Thursday
morning. This rainfall could lead to considerable flash and urban
flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Francine, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Cameron, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-10 ft
Vermilion Bay...5-10 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-7 ft
High Island, TX to Cameron, LA...3-5 ft
Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA to MS/AL Border...2-4 ft
Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas...2-4 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to High Island, TX...1-3 ft
Galveston Bay...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances. Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees. However, there
may be some overtopping of local levees. For information specific
to your area, please see products issued by your local National
Weather Service forecast office.
 
Minor coastal flooding is possible along the coast of Mexico in
areas of onshore winds.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine are affecting portions of the
coast of northeastern Mexico and southern Texas.  These swells are
expected to spread across the northwestern and northern Gulf of
Mexico coastline during the next day or so.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
