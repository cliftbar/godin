## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Francine was
located near latitude 26.4 North, longitude 94.3 West. Francine is
moving toward the northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h).   A faster
northeastward motion is expected through Wednesday.  On the forecast
track, Francine is anticipated to make landfall in Louisiana
Wednesday afternoon or evening. After landfall, the center is
expected to move northward into Mississippi Wednesday night and
Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Additional strengthening is expected through Wednesday
morning.  Francine is expected to weaken quickly after it
moves inland.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on data from the Air Force and
NOAA Hurricane Hunters is 980 mb (28.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Francine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO
header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area Wednesday afternoon, with tropical storm conditions
arriving in the warning area Wednesday morning. Hurricane
conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch area Wednesday
afternoon and Wednesday night.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area along
the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama Wednesday and 
Wednesday night.
 
RAINFALL:  Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4
to 8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches across eastern
Louisiana, Mississippi, far southern Alabama and the western
Florida Panhandle through Friday morning. This rainfall could lead
to considerable flash and urban flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Vermilion/Cameron Line, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-10 ft
Vermilion Bay...5-10 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-7 ft
Cameron, LA to Vermilion/Cameron Line, LA...3-5 ft
Pointe a la Hache, LA to MS/AL Border...3-5 ft
Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees.  However,
there may be some overtopping of local levees.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible Wednesday into Wednesday
night across parts of southeast Louisiana, southern Mississippi,
southern Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine are affecting much of the 
northern and northwestern Gulf Coast.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
