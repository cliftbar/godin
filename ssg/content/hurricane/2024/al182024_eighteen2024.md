## Official Advisory Discussion
At 400 PM EST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Rafael was 
located near latitude 15.5 North, longitude 76.7 West. Rafael is 
moving toward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h). A northwestward motion 
is expected to begin later tonight and forecast to continue for the 
next few days. On the forecast track, the system is expected to move 
near Jamaica late tonight, be near or over the Cayman Islands late 
Tuesday, and approach Cuba on Wednesday.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Steady to rapid strengthening is now forecast and the 
system is forecast to become a hurricane on Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on data from the 
Air Force Hurricane Hunters is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Rafael can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO
header WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the Cayman Islands by 
Tuesday afternoon and are possible in western Cuba and the Isle of 
Youth on Wednesday. Tropical storm conditions are expected in 
Jamaica by late tonight and are possible in central Cuba, and in the 
lower and middle Florida Keys on Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Heavy rainfall will impact areas of the Western Caribbean 
with the heaviest rainfall occurring over Jamaica and portions of 
Cuba through mid-week. Rainfall totals between 3 to 6 inches with 
locally up to 9 inches are expected.  Flooding and mudslides could 
occur over portions of Jamaica and Cuba.

Heavy rainfall will spread north into Florida and adjacent areas of 
the Southeast United States mid to late week.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Storm Rafael, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
<a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf">www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf</a>
 
STORM SURGE:  Minor coastal flooding is possible in Jamaica tonight.
Storm surge could raise water levels by 1-3 feet above normal tide
levels in the Cayman Islands on Tuesday, and could raise water
levels by as much as 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas
of onshore winds along the southern coast of Pinar del Rio, Cuba,
including the Isle of Youth.

The combination of a storm surge and the tide will cause normally 
dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving 
inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the following 
heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak 
surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Dry Tortugas...1-3 ft
Lower Florida Keys...1-2 ft

SURF:  Swells generated by the system are expected to affect much of 
the western Caribbean during the next few days. These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
