## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Milton was
located near latitude 23.4 North, longitude 86.5 West.  Milton is
moving toward the northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A northeastward
motion with some increase in forward speed is expected overnight
through Wednesday.  A turn toward the east-northeast and east is
expected on Thursday and Friday.  On the forecast track, the center
of Milton will move across the eastern Gulf of Mexico tonight and
Wednesday, make landfall along the west-central coast of Florida
Wednesday night, and move off the east coast of Florida over the
Atlantic Ocean on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 160 mph (260 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Milton is a category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Fluctuations in intensity are likely while
Milton moves across the eastern Gulf of Mexico, but Milton is
expected to be a dangerous major hurricane when it reaches the
west-central coast of Florida Wednesday night.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 915 mb (27.02 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Key Messages for Milton can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the 
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by 
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could 
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated 
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Egmont Key, FL to Boca Grande, FL...10-15 ft
Tampa Bay...10-15 ft
Anclote River, FL to Egmont Key, FL...9-13 ft
Boca Grande, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...8-12 ft
Charlotte Harbor...8-12 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...5-8 ft
Aripeka, FL to Anclote River, FL...5-8 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Sebastian Inlet, FL to Altamaha Sound, GA...3-5 ft
Altamaha Sound, GA to Edisto Beach, SC...2-4 ft
Suwannee River, FL to Aripeka, FL...2-4 ft
Dry Tortugas...2-4 ft
St. Johns River...2-4 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 6 to 12 inches, with localized totals
up to 18 inches, are expected across central to northern portions of
the Florida Peninsula through Thursday.  This rainfall brings the
risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding,
along with moderate to major river flooding.
 
Additional rainfall amounts of  2 to 4 inches, with isolated totals
around 6 inches, are expected across northern portions of the
Yucatan Peninsula.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area across Florida beginning late Wednesday through early Thursday
and are possible in the hurricane watch area on Thursday. Tropical
storm conditions are expected to begin in the warning area on the
west coast of Florida around midday Wednesday, spreading across the
peninsula and reaching the east coast Wednesday evening. Tropical
storm conditions are expected to begin in the warning area on the
east coast of Florida late Wednesday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the 
northwestern Bahamas on Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
on the Georgia and South Carolina coasts on Thursday.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible over central and southern
Florida through Thursday night.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Milton are expected to continue to
affect much of the Gulf Coast during the next day or two, and are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
