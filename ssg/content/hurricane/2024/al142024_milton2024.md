## Official Advisory Discussion
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Milton was located
near latitude 22.4 North, longitude 93.8 West. Milton is moving
toward the east near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general motion is 
expected today. An eastward to east-northeastward motion is 
forecast on Monday, followed by a faster northeastward motion on 
Tuesday and Wednesday.  On the forecast track, Milton is forecast 
to move just north of the Yucatan Peninsula and across the southern 
Gulf of Mexico Monday and Tuesday and approach the west coast of 
the Florida Peninsula by Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts.   Milton is forecast to rapidly intensify during
the next couple of days and become a major hurricane on Monday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 983 mb (29.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Hurricane Milton can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml

STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 2 
to 4 feet above ground level along the northern coast of the 
Yucatan Peninsula in areas of onshore flow.  Near the coast, the 
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.

RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches, with localized totals 
up to 15 inches, are expected across portions of the Florida 
Peninsula and the Keys through Wednesday night. This rainfall brings 
the risk of considerable flash, urban, and areal flooding, along 
with the potential for moderate to major river flooding.

Milton will also produce rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches across 
portions of the northern Yucatan Peninsula.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero. 
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin as early as 
Monday morning in the warning area, and hurricane conditions are 
possible beginning Monday afternoon.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the system are affecting the coast of the 
southwestern Gulf of Mexico today.  These swells are expected to 
spread northward and eastward along much of the Gulf Coast within 
the next day or two, and are likely to cause life-threatening surf 
and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
