## Official Advisory Discussion
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Milton was located
near latitude 22.7 North, longitude 87.5 West.  Milton wobbled
earlier today, but the longer-term motion is toward the
east-northeast near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A turn toward the northeast
with an increase in forward speed is expected to begin tonight and
continue through early Thursday.  A turn toward the east-northeast
and east is expected on Thursday and Friday.  On the forecast
track, the center of Milton will move across the eastern Gulf of
Mexico through Wednesday, make landfall along the west-central
coast of Florida Wednesday night, and move off the east coast of
Florida over the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday.
 
Satellite images indicate that maximum sustained winds have
increased to near 165 mph (270 km/h) with higher gusts.  Milton is a
category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.
Fluctuations in intensity are likely while Milton moves across the
eastern Gulf of Mexico, but Milton is expected to be a dangerous
major hurricane when it reaches the west-central coast of Florida
Wednesday night.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 918 mb (27.11 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Key Messages for Milton can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC

STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 2
to 4 feet above ground level along the northern coast of the
Yucatan Peninsula in areas of onshore winds.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Anclote River, FL to Englewood, FL...10-15 ft
Tampa Bay...10-15 ft
Englewood, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...8-12 ft
Charlotte Harbor...8-12 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...5-10 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...5-8 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...3-5 ft
Sebastian Inlet, FL to Altamaha Sound, GA...3-5 ft
Altamaha Sound, GA to Edisto Beach, SC...2-4 ft
Suwannee River, FL to Yankeetown, FL...2-4 ft
Dry Tortugas...2-4 ft
St. Johns River...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 6 to 12 inches, with localized totals
up to 18 inches, are expected across central to northern portions of
the Florida Peninsula through Thursday.  This rainfall brings the
risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding,
along with moderate to major river flooding.
 
Additional rainfall amounts of  2 to 4 inches, with isolated totals
around 6 inches, are expected across northern portions of the
Yucatan Peninsula.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue in the warning areas
in Mexico this evening.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area
across Florida beginning late Wednesday through early Thursday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the warning area
on the west coast of Florida around midday Wednesday, spreading
across the peninsula and reaching the east coast Wednesday evening.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
on the Georgia and South Carolina coasts on Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the extreme northwestern
Bahamas on Thursday.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible over central and southern
Florida beginning late tonight and continuing through early Thursday
morning.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Milton are expected to continue to
affect much of the Gulf Coast within the next day or two, and are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
