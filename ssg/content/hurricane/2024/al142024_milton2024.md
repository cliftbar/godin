## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Milton was located
near latitude 28.5 North, longitude 80.5 West. Milton is moving
toward the northeast near 18 mph (30 km/h) and this general motion
is expected to continue today, followed by a turn toward the east
tonight.  On the forecast track, the center of Milton will move
away from Florida and to the north of the Bahamas today.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is expected, but Milton is forecast to
become a powerful extratropical low tonight.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles 
(335 km).  A sustained wind of 75 mph (121 km/h) and a gust to 83 
mph (134 km/h) was recently reported at a Weatherstem station in 
Marineland.  A sustained wind of 61 mph (98 km/h) and a gust to 76 
mph (122 km/h) was recently reported at a Weatherstem station on 
South Hutchinson Island.  A sustained wind of 60 mph (97 km/h) and a 
gust of 87 mph (140 km/h) was recently reported at Daytona Beach 
International Airport.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface 
observations is 976 mb (28.82 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Milton can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Sebastian Inlet, FL to Altamaha Sound, GA...3-5 ft
St. Johns River...2-4 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches are expected
across portions of the east-central to northeast Florida coast
through this morning.  This rainfall will continue to bring the risk
of considerable flash and urban flooding, along with moderate to
major river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are occurring within the hurricane
warning area in Florida.  Tropical storm conditions are occurring
in the tropical storm warning areas in Florida, Georgia, South
Carolina, and the Bahamas.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Milton are expected to continue to
affect portions of the southeast U.S. and the Bahamas during the
next couple of days.  These swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
