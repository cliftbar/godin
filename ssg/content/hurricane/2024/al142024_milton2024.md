## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Milton was located
near latitude 26.9 North, longitude 83.4 West.  Milton is moving
toward the northeast near 17 mph (28 km/h), and this motion is
expected to continue through tonight.  A turn toward the 
east-northeast is expected on Thursday, followed by a turn toward 
the east on Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of Milton 
will make landfall near or just south of the Tampa Bay region this 
evening, move across the central part of the Florida peninsula 
overnight, and emerge off the east coast of Florida on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Milton is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Milton could still be a major hurricane when 
it reaches the coast of west-central Florida this evening, and it 
will remain a hurricane while it moves across central Florida 
through Thursday.  Milton is forecast to weaken over the western 
Atlantic and become extratropical by Thursday night.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 255 miles 
(405 km). A WeatherFlow site located in Egmont Channel (XEGM) 
recently reported a sustained wind speed of 51 mph (82 km/h) with a 
wind gust of 63 mph (102 km/h). A WeatherFlow site located on the 
Sunshine Skyway Fishing Pier (XSKY) recently reported a sustained 
wind speed of 47 mph (76 km/h) with a wind gust of 62 mph (100 
km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure based on Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
Hunter data is 948 mb (28.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Key Messages for Milton can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Anna Maria Island, FL to Boca Grande, FL...9-13 ft
Anclote River, FL to Anna Maria Island, FL...6-9 ft
Tampa Bay...6-9 ft
Boca Grande, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...8-12 ft
Charlotte Harbor...8-12 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...5-8 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Sebastian Inlet, FL to Altamaha Sound, GA...3-5 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Anclote River, FL...2-4 ft
Dry Tortugas...2-4 ft
St. Johns River...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 6 to 12 inches, with localized totals
up to 18 inches, are expected across central to northern portions of
the Florida Peninsula through Thursday.  This rainfall brings the
risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding,
along with moderate to major river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area across Florida this evening through Thursday morning and are
possible in the hurricane watch area tonight and on Thursday.
Tropical storm conditions are occurring along the west coast of
Florida and are forecast to spread across the peninsula and reach
the east coast this evening or tonight.  Tropical storm conditions
are expected to begin in the warning area along the Georgia
and South Carolina coast on Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
northwestern Bahamas on Thursday.
 
TORNADOES: Several tornadoes, possibly including a few strong 
tornadoes, are likely this afternoon and tonight across parts of 
central and southern Florida.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Milton are expected to continue to affect
much of the Gulf Coast and will increase along the southeastern U.S.
coast during the next day or two.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
