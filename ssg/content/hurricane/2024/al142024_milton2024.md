## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Milton
was located near latitude 29.5 North, longitude 76.3 West.  Milton 
is moving toward the east near 21 mph (33 km/h), and this general 
motion with an increase in forward speed is expected during the next 
several days.  On the forecast track, the center of the 
post-tropical cyclone will pass to the south of Bermuda late Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast during the 
next several days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310 miles (500 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 983 mb (29.03 inches).
