## Official Advisory Discussion
At 300 AM GMT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Isaac was
located near latitude 44.4 North, longitude 32.8 West. Isaac is
moving toward the northeast near 14 mph (22 km/h). A turn toward 
the north-northeast at a similar forward speed is expected on 
Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Slow weakening is expected during the next several days. 
Isaac is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone later today.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 975 mb (28.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and an upstream deep-layer trough
will affect the Azores over the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
