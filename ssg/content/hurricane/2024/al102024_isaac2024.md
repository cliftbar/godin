## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Isaac was 
located near latitude 37.1 North, longitude 54.1 West. Isaac is 
moving toward the east near 12 mph (19 km/h) and a general eastward 
to east-northeastward motion at a slightly faster speed is 
anticipated over the next several days.
 
Recent satellite wind data indicates that maximum sustained winds 
are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. Some strengthening is 
forecast during the next couple of days and Isaac could be near 
hurricane intensity by the end of the week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles (350 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough are affecting portions of the coast of Bermuda and
could spread into the Azores by this weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
