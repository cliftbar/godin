## Official Advisory Discussion
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Isaac was located 
near latitude 41.3 North, longitude 38.4 West. Isaac is moving 
toward the northeast near 18 mph (30 km/h).  A slower east-northeast 
to northeast motion is expected during the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is expected, and Isaac is forecast to be
a post-tropical cyclone on Monday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles
(315 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 968 mb (28.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough will affect the Azores over the next few days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
