## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Isaac was
located near latitude 37.1 North, longitude 52.8 West. Isaac is
moving toward the east near 12 mph (19 km/h) and a general eastward 
to east-northeastward motion is expected to continue for the next 
several days. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours and Isaac 
could be become a hurricane by Friday over the open Subtropical 
Atlantic. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough are affecting portions of the coast of Bermuda and
could spread into the Azores by this weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
