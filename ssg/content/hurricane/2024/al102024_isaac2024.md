## Official Advisory Discussion
At 900 AM GMT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Isaac was
located near latitude 44.7 North, longitude 31.3 West.  Isaac is
moving toward the east-northeast near 15 mph (24 km/h).  A turn
toward the northeast at a similar forward speed is expected on
Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Slow weakening is expected during the next several days.
Isaac is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone later today.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 975 mb (28.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac will affect the Azores over the 
next few days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening 
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your 
local weather office.
