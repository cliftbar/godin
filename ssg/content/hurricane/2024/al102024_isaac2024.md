## Official Advisory Discussion
At 300 AM GMT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Isaac was located 
near latitude 42.1 North, longitude 37.6 West. Isaac is moving 
toward the northeast near 14 mph (22 km/h). A slower east-northeast 
to northeast motion is expected during the next couple of days, 
followed by a turn toward the north-northeast on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) 
with higher gusts, and continued weakening is expected over the next 
few days. Isaac is forecast to become a powerful post-tropical 
cyclone by Sunday night or early Monday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles
(335 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough will affect the Azores over the next few days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
