## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Isaac was located
near latitude 37.0 North, longitude 48.5 West. Isaac is moving
toward the east near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this motion with a
gradual turn to the east-northeast is expected over the next
several days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Additional strengthening is expected during the next day or 
so followed by gradual weakening by the end of this weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles
(110 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough are affecting portions of the coast of Bermuda and
could spread into the Azores by this weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
