## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Isaac was
located near latitude 37.5 North, longitude 50.6 West. Isaac is
moving toward the east near 10 mph (17 km/h), and a turn toward the
east-northeast is expected by the weekend. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast, and Isaac is expected reach or be near
hurricane strength by late Friday or early Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough are affecting portions of the coast of Bermuda and
could spread into the Azores by this weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
