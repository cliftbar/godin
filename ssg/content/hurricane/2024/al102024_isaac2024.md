## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Isaac was located
near latitude 37.8 North, longitude 45.3 West. Isaac is moving
toward the east near 16 mph (26 km/h). A gradual turn to the 
east-northeast is expected with a slight decrease in forward speed 
over the next day or so. On Saturday, a gradual turn to the 
northeast is forecast and this motion should continue through 
Monday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Some slight additional strengthening is expected 
tonight or Saturday morning followed by gradual weakening through 
early next week. Isaac is expected to be a post-tropical cyclone on 
Monday. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 976 mb (28.82 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough could spread into the Azores by this weekend.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
