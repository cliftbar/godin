## Official Advisory Discussion
At 900 AM CST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rafael was located 
near latitude 24.5 North, longitude 85.2 West. Rafael is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A turn toward the 
west is expected later today, with this general motion continuing 
through the weekend. On the forecast track, Rafael is expected to 
move over the southern Gulf of Mexico for the next few days.
 
Data from the Air Force Hurricane Hunters indicate that maximum 
sustained winds have decreased to near 100 mph (155 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Some additional weakening is anticipated during the 
next few days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 971 mb (28.68 inches).
