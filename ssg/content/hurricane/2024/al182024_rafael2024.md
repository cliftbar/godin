## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1000 PM EST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rafael was 
located near latitude 23.5 North, longitude 83.6 West. Rafael is 
moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A general 
northwestward motion is anticipated tonight. A turn toward the west 
at a slower forward speed is expected on Thursday, with this general 
motion continuing through Saturday.  On the forecast track, Rafael 
is expected to move away from western Cuba over the southeastern 
Gulf of Mexico tonight. Rafael is then forecast to move over the 
southern Gulf of Mexico for the next few days.
 
Reports from Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some weakening is possible tonight and Thursday, 
with little change in strength expected on Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from the Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft data is 969 mb (28.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to continue in portions of
western Cuba for the next few hours.  Tropical storm conditions
are expected in parts of the lower and middle Florida Keys through 
tonight.
 
RAINFALL: Additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches are expected 
into Thursday, leading to storm total accumulations of 12 inches 
across portions of western Cuba.  This may lead to areas of flash 
flooding and mudslides, especially along the higher terrain. 

Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected for the Lower and 
Middle Florida Keys. 

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Hurricane Rafael, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge flooding along the coast of Cuba should
subside tonight.
 
The combination of a storm surge and the tide will cause normally
dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving
inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the following
heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Dry Tortugas...1-3 ft
Lower Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
TORNADOES: A couple of brief tornadoes remain possible this evening, 
mainly over parts of the Lower Florida Keys.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael are expected to affect much of the 
northwestern Caribbean during the next day or so and will also 
spread across most of the Gulf of Mexico from east to west late this 
week into the weekend. These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
