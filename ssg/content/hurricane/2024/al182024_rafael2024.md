## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1000 AM EST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rafael was
located near latitude 21.4 North, longitude 81.9 West. Rafael is
moving toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A general
northwestward motion is anticipated over the next day or so,
followed by a gradual west-northwestward turn in the Gulf of Mexico.
On the forecast track, Rafael is expected move near or just east of
the Isle of Youth during the next few hours, and make landfall
in western Cuba later today.  Rafael is forecast to move into the
southeastern Gulf of Mexico tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 110 mph (175 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is expected, and
Rafael is forecast to be a major hurricane when it makes landfall 
in Cuba later today.  Rafael is forecast to weaken over Cuba but is 
expected to emerge into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico as a 
hurricane.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in western Cuba and the 
Isle of Youth today.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in 
parts of west-central Cuba and the lower and middle Florida Keys 
today and tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are possible farther 
east in central Cuba today.
 
RAINFALL: RAINFALL: Heavy rainfall will impact areas of the Western
Caribbean through early Thursday, particularly across the Cayman
Islands into western Cuba. Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches are
expected across portions of western Cuba, with isolated higher
totals up to 12 inches anticipated across areas of higher terrain.
This will lead to areas of flash flooding and mudslides. Across the
Cayman Islands additional rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected.
 
Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected for the Lower and
Middle Florida Keys.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Rafael, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels as much as 9 to
14 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along
the southern coast of Cuba in the Hurricane Warning area, including
the Isle of Youth.
 
The combination of a storm surge and the tide will cause normally
dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving
inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the following
heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Dry Tortugas...1-3 ft
Lower Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
TORNADOES: A couple of tornadoes are possible through tonight over
the Florida Keys and far southwestern Florida mainland.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael are expected to affect much of the
western Caribbean during the next day or so and will also spread
across most of the Gulf of Mexico from east to west late this week
into the weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
