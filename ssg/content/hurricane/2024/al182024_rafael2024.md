## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1000 PM EST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Rafael was 
located near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 77.2 West. Rafael is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). A 
northwestward turn with a little more acceleration is anticipated 
over the next few days. On the forecast track, the storm is expected 
to be near Jamaica on Tuesday morning, be near or over the Cayman 
Islands Tuesday night, and approach Cuba on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Steady to rapid intensification is forecast over the next 24 
to 36 h, and Rafael is forecast to become a hurricane in the 
northwestern Caribbean near the Cayman Islands with further 
strengthening before it makes landfall in Cuba. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from dropsonde data from the 
Air Force Reconnaissance Aircraft is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Rafael can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO
header WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the Cayman Islands by
Tuesday afternoon and are also expected in western Cuba and the Isle
of Youth on Wednesday. Tropical storm conditions are expected in
Jamaica tonight into Tuesday morning and are expected in parts of 
west-central Cuba, possible farther east in central Cuba, and in 
the lower and middle Florida Keys on Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Heavy rainfall will impact areas of the Western Caribbean
with the heaviest rainfall occurring over Jamaica and portions of
Cuba through mid-week. Rainfall totals between 3 to 6 inches with
locally up to 9 inches are expected.  Flooding and mudslides could
occur over portions of Jamaica and Cuba.
 
Heavy rainfall will spread north into Florida and adjacent areas of
the Southeast United States by mid to late week. Rainfall totals of 
1 to 3 inches are expected for the lower and middle Florida Keys. 
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Rafael, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE:  Minor coastal flooding is possible in Jamaica tonight. 
Storm surge could raise water levels by 1 to 3 feet above normal 
tide levels in the Cayman Islands on Tuesday, and could raise water 
levels by as much as 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas 
of onshore winds along the southern coast of Cuba in the Hurricane 
Warning area, including the Isle of Youth.
 
The combination of a storm surge and the tide will cause normally
dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving
inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the following
heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Dry Tortugas...1-3 ft
Lower Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the system are expected to affect much of
the western Caribbean during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
