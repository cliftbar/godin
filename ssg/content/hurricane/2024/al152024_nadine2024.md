## Official Advisory Discussion
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nadine was
located near latitude 17.4 North, longitude 87.1 West.  Nadine is
moving toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general
motion with an increase in forward speed is expected through today
and tonight.  On the forecast track, the center of Nadine is
forecast to make landfall along the coast of Belize late this
morning or around midday, and then continue across northern
Guatemala and southeastern Mexico late this afternoon into tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some slight strengthening is possible this morning before Nadine
makes landfall.  Weakening is forecast to begin this afternoon once
Nadine is inland, and the system is likely to dissipate over
southeastern Mexico by early Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
north of the center.  A WeatherFlow station in Cancun, Mexico,
recently reported a sustained wind of 41 mph (67 km/h) and a gust
to 51 mph (81 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
