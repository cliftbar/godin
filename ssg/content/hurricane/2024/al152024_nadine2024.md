## Official Advisory Discussion
Recent satellite-derived wind data indicate that the disturbance 
over the northwestern Caribbean Sea has become a tropical storm.  
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nadine was 
centered near latitude 17.3 North, longitude 86.4 West.  Nadine is 
moving toward the west near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this general motion 
should continue through tonight.  On the forecast track, Nadine is
expected to move inland along the coast of Belize later today.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some additional slight strengthening is possible before Nadine makes 
landfall later today.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles (315 km) 
north of the center.  A WeatherFlow station at Xel-Ha Park near 
Tulum, Mexico, recently measured a wind gust to 40 mph (65 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
