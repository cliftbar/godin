HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Tropical Depression Sara can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches are expected 
over northern Honduras, with storm total amounts locally as high as 
40 inches. The risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flooding 
impacts will continue, especially along and near the Sierra La 
Esperanza.

Across portions of Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala, western 
Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo, Tropical Storm 
Sara is expected to produce an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain with 
localized storm totals around 15 inches. This will result in areas 
of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along with the potential of 
mudslides.
