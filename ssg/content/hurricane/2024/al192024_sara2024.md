## Official Advisory Discussion
At 900 AM CST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Sara was
located near latitude 17.1 North, longitude 88.4 West. Sara is
moving toward the west-northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h). A turn
northwestward or north-northwestward with some increase in forward
speed is expected through tonight. On the forecast track, the center
of Sara will move further inland over the Yucatan Peninsula today
before it opens up into a trough by tonight or tomorrow.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast as the storm moves further inland, and Sara is
expected to become a remnant low before it opens up into a trough
over the southern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula tonight or on
Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) 
from the center. Recently, a surface station at Calabash Caye 
offshore of the Belize mainland reported a sustained wind of 31 mph 
(50 km/h) with a gust up to 41 mph (67 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
