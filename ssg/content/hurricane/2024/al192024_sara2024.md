## Official Advisory Discussion
At 900 PM CST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Sara was
located near latitude 16.5 North, longitude 87.3 West. Sara is
moving toward the west-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h), and this 
general motion with some increase in forward speed is expected 
until landfall. On the forecast track, the center of Sara will 
move over Belize during the day on Sunday.
 
Air Force Reserve aircraft data indicate that the maximum sustained 
winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is anticipated until landfall on Sunday, 
with dissipation expected over the southern portion of the Yucatan 
Peninsula by early Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km), 
primarily north of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches) 
based on dropsonde data.

Elsewhere across the rest of Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, eastern
Guatemala, western Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo,
Tropical Storm Sara is expected to produce 5 to 10 inches of rain
