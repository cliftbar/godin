located near latitude 16.8 North, longitude 87.8 West. Sara is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h) and this

Weakening is forecast after the storm moves inland, and dissipation 
is expected over the southern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula 
tonight or Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
