of life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding and 
mudslides, especially along and near the Sierra La Esperanza.

Elsewhere across the rest of Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, eastern 
Guatemala, western Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo, 
Tropical Storm Sara is expected to produce 5 to 10 inches of rain 
with localized totals around 15 inches through early next week. This 
will result in areas of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along 
with the potential of mudslides.
