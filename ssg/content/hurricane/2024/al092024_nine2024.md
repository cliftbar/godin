## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Helene was
located near latitude 19.5 North, longitude 84.3 West.  Helene is
moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue through early Wednesday.  A 
northward to north-northeastward motion at a faster forward speed 
is expected on Wednesday and Thursday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Helene will move across the far northwestern Caribbean 
Sea through tonight, and then move across the eastern Gulf of 
Mexico Wednesday and Thursday, potentially reaching the Gulf coast 
of Florida late Thursday.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that the system has acquired a well-defined center of circulation, 
and maximum sustained winds have increased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast, and 
Helene is expected to become a hurricane on Wednesday.  Continued 
strengthening is anticipated after that time, and Helene could 
become a major hurricane on Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
to the east of the center.
 
Data from the Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the minimum 
central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Helene can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Helene is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
4 to 8 inches over western Cuba and the Cayman Islands with isolated
totals around 12 inches. Over the eastern Yucatan Peninsula, 4 to 6
inches of rain are expected with isolated totals over 8 inches. This
rainfall brings a risk of considerable flooding.
 
Over the Southeastern U.S., Helene is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches with isolated totals around 12
inches. This rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable
flash and urban flooding, with minor to moderate river flooding
likely, and isolated major river flooding possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Helene, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall
Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and
the Flash Flood Risk graphic at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Ochlockonee River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...10-15 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...6-10 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...5-10 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...5-8 ft
Tampa Bay...5-8 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...4-7 ft
Englewood, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...3-5 ft
Charlotte Harbor...3-5 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the southern
coast of Pinar del Rio, Cuba, including the Isle of Youth.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
ground level in areas of onshore winds within the warning area along
the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch areas in
Cuba and Mexico by early Wednesday.  Hurricane conditions are
possible within the U.S. watch areas Wednesday night and early
Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning
areas in the Cayman Islands, Cuba, and Mexico today.  Tropical
storm conditions are expected in the warning area in the Lower
Florida Keys beginning on Wednesday, and are possible in the watch
area in the Middle Florida Keys beginning late Wednesday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Helene will affect the southern coast
of Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico during the next couple
of days.  Swells will spread northward toward the west coast of
Florida and the northeastern Gulf Coast on Wednesday and Thursday.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
