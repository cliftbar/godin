## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Gordon
was located near latitude 19.0 North, longitude 46.8 West. The
depression is moving toward the west near 7 mph (11 km/h). A west
to west-southwest motion is expected during the next day or so, with
Gordon forecast to slow down considerably through the middle of the
week.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 30 mph (45 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Little change in strength is forecast over the next 
several days, though Gordon could become a post-tropical remnant low 
at any time. 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
