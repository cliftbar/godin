## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gordon was
located near latitude 20.1 North, longitude 40.9 West. Gordon is
moving toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A slightly 
slower westward or west-southwestward motion is forecast during the

Some weakening is anticipated over the next day or so, and Gordon is 
forecast to become a depression by early Sunday. Gradual
