## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Gordon

depression is moving toward the west near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A turn
toward the north is expected during the next day or so, followed by 
a turn toward the north-northeast on Wednesday.
 
Satellite wind data indicate that the maximum sustained winds are 
near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.  Gordon could gradually 
re-intensify by midweek and become a tropical storm again.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
