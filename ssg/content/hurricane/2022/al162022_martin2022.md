## Official Advisory Discussion
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Martin was located
near latitude 45.6 North, longitude 37.9 West. Martin is moving
toward the northeast near 48 mph (78 km/h). A turn toward the north 
at a slightly slower forward speed is expected this evening. 
Martin's forward motion is forecast to slow down substantially on 
Friday. A general east to east-southeastward motion is then 
forecast by Friday night, which will likely continue through the 
weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts. Martin is forecast to become a very powerful post-tropical 
cyclone within the next few hours. Martin's peak sustained winds 
will likely begin to decrease on Friday, but it will continue to 
produce strong winds over a very large area well into the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 520
miles (835 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches).
