## Official Advisory Discussion
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Lisa was
located near latitude 19.8 North, longitude 95.5 West. The
depression is moving toward the north-northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h), 
and a slow motion toward the north is expected today. Lisa or its 
remnants are then forecast to stall or drift southward through the 
remainder of the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual weakening is forecast, and Lisa is expected to become a
remnant low later this morning.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
