## Official Advisory Discussion
At 200 AM CVT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Hermine 
was located near latitude 22.9 North, longitude 20.3 West. The 
depression is moving toward the north near 10 mph (17 km/h) and this 
motion is expected to continue during the next day or so. After that 
time, a turn toward the west-northwest or northwest is expected.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Weakening is forecast, and Hermine is expected to become a remnant 
low later today.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
