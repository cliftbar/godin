## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Colin
was located near latitude 34.4 North, longitude 77.8 West. The
depression is moving toward the northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h). A
slightly faster northeast to east-northeast motion is expected
during the next day or so. On the forecast track, the center of
Colin or it remnants is expected to move northeastward along or
just inland of the North Carolina coast through Sunday afternoon.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is likely, and Colin is
expected to degenerate to a remnant area of low pressure later
tonight or on Sunday.  The system is expected to dissipate
completely Sunday night or Monday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface
observations is 1014 mb (29.95 inches).
