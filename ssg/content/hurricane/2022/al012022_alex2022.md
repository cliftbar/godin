## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Alex was
located near latitude 34.0 North, longitude 63.8 West. Alex is
moving toward the east-northeast near 29 mph (46 km/h) and this 
general motion is expected to continue into Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some weakening is forecast, and Alex is expected to become 
an extratropical low later today.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center. During the past couple of hours, the Bermuda 
Airport reported a sustained wind of 43 mph (69 km/h) with a gust to 
56 mph (90 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 993 mb (29.33 inches).
