## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ian was located
near latitude 32.4 North, longitude 79.0 West. Ian is moving toward
the north near 14 mph (22 km/h).  Ian is forecast to move more
quickly toward the north today followed by a turn toward the
north-northwest by tonight.  On the forecast track, the center of
Ian will reach the coast of South Carolina today, and then move
farther inland across eastern South Carolina and central
North Carolina tonight and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Ian should maintain about the same strength before landfall
later, then weaken and rapidly transition into a post-tropical
cyclone overnight.  Ian should dissipate over western North
Carolina or Virginia late Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275
miles (445 km).  A sustained wind of 62 mph (100 km/h) and a gust to
87 mph (140 km/h) were recently reported at an elevated WeatherFlow
station on Winyah Bay Range in South Carolina.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches)
based on data from NOAA buoy 41004, located about 45 miles
southeast of Charleston.
