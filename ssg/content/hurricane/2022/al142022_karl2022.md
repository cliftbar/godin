## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Karl
was located near latitude 19.1 North, longitude 92.8 West. The
depression is moving toward the south near 3 mph (6 km/h).  
A south-southwestward to southwestward motion is expected during the
next day or so as Karl moves over the Bay of Campeche. On the
forecast track, the center of Karl should be near the coast of
southern Mexico on Saturday.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that the maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 
km/h) with higher gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast, and Karl is 
expected to become a post-tropical cyclone Saturday and dissipate 
by early Sunday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
