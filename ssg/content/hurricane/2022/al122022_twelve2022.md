## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Twelve
was located near latitude 14.9 North, longitude 30.5 West.  The
depression is moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A 
fairly constant motion toward the northwest or north-northwest is 
expected through Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next couple of 
days, but the depression has some potential to become a tropical 
storm tonight or on Wednesday.  The system is expected to dissipate 
by Thursday night.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
