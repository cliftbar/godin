## Official Advisory Discussion
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bonnie was 
located near latitude 11.3 North, longitude 85.1 West. Bonnie is 
moving toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h), and a continued 
westward motion with a gradual decrease in forward speed is expected 
later today.  A west-northwestward motion is expected to begin 
tonight or on Sunday and continue into Tuesday.  On the forecast 
track, Bonnie will move across Lake Nicaragua during the next 
several hours and emerge over the eastern Pacific Ocean later this 
morning.  Bonnie will then move offshore of but parallel to the 
coasts of El Salvador, Guatemala, and southern Mexico today through 
Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with
higher gusts. Gradual strengthening is forecast after Bonnie emerges
over the eastern Pacific later today and should continue through 
Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
