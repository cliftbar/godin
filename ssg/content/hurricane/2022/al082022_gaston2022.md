## Official Advisory Discussion
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gaston was
located near latitude 39.1 North, longitude 37.5 West. Gaston is
moving toward the west near 10 mph (17 km/h) and a general west to
west-southwestward motion is expected until dissipation.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with
higher gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast over the next few days,
and Gaston is forecast to become a post-tropical tonight and
dissipate entirely later this week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
