## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Eleven 
was located near latitude 16.7 North, longitude 34.7 West. The 
depression is moving toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 
km/h) and a general north to north-northwest motion is forecast over 
the next several days until the system dissipates.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some slight strengthening could occur overnight, but weakening is 
expected to begin by tomorrow with the system dissipating by 
Saturday.  
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
