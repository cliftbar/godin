## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Eleven
was located near latitude 19.1 North, longitude 37.4 West. The
depression is moving toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h)
and a general northwestward motion is expected until the depression
dissipates in the next day or so.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is anticipated, and the system is forecast to degenerate
into a trough of low pressure, possibly as soon as this afternoon.
 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
