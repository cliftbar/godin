## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Fiona was located
near latitude 39.6 North, longitude 61.0 West. Fiona is moving
toward the north-northeast near 40 mph (65 km/h).  A slower
north-northeast or northward motion is expected through Sunday.  On 
the forecast track, the center of Fiona will approach Nova Scotia 
later today, move across Nova Scotia and into the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence on Saturday, and then across Labrador and over the
Labrador Sea by late Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Fiona is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Although gradual weakening is forecast 
during the next couple of days, Fiona is expected to be a powerful 
hurricane-force cyclone when it moves across Atlantic Canada.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 345
miles (555 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 940 mb (27.76 inches).
