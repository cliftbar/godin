## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Fiona was located
near latitude 19.1 North, longitude 69.2 West.  Fiona is moving
toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  This general motion is
expected to continue through tonight, followed by a turn toward the
north-northwest on Tuesday and to the north on Wednesday.  On the
forecast track, the center of Fiona will move over the southwestern
Atlantic this afternoon.  The center is forecast to pass near or to
the east of the Turks and Caicos on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Strengthening is expected during the next few days after the
hurricane emerges over the southwestern Atlantic, and Fiona is
forecast to become a major hurricane by Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).  An AWOS observation station at Samana El Catey, 
Dominican Republic recently reported a wind gust to 81 mph (130 
km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).
