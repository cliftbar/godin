## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Julia was
located near latitude 12.6 North, longitude 81.3 West.  Julia is
moving toward the west near 17 mph (28 km/h).  A continued westward 
motion with some decrease in forward speed is expected during the 
next couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Julia is 
expected to reach the coast of Nicaragua overnight, move across 
Nicaragua on Sunday, and then move near or along the Pacific coasts 
of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala through Monday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some additional strengthening is forecast this evening and 
tonight, and Julia could become a hurricane while passing near San 
Andres and Providencia Islands this evening.  Julia is also 
expected to be a hurricane when it reaches the coast of Nicaragua 
overnight.  Weakening is expected once Julia moves inland, but it is 
forecast to still be a tropical storm when it moves off the Pacific 
coast of Nicaragua late Sunday.  Julia should weaken to a tropical 
depression on Monday and dissipate by Monday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
