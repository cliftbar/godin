## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Julia was
located inland near latitude 12.4 North, longitude 85.4 West.  
Julia is moving toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this 
motion is expected to continue today, with a slightly slower 
west-northwestward motion tonight and Monday.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Julia is expected to continue moving over 
Nicaragua today and emerge off the Pacific coast by this evening.  
Julia is then expected to move very near to and parallel to the 
Pacific coasts of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala tonight and 
Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast during 
the next day or two, but Julia is still expected to be a tropical 
storm when it moves near the Pacific coasts of Nicaragua, Honduras, 
and El Salvador tonight and Monday.  Julia is expected to dissipate 
near the coast of Guatemala by Monday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 993 mb (29.33 inches).
