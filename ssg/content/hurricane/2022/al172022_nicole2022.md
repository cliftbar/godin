## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1000 AM EST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nicole was
located near latitude 26.5 North, longitude 76.7 West. Nicole is
moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A turn toward the
west-northwest is expected tonight, followed by a turn toward the
northwest on Thursday, and north or north-northeast on Friday.  On
the forecast track, the center of Nicole will move near or over
the Abacos and Grand Bahama in the northwestern Bahamas today and
move onshore the east coast of Florida within the hurricane warning
area tonight.  Nicole's center is then expected to move across
central and northern Florida into southern Georgia Thursday and
Thursday night, and then across the Carolinas Friday and Friday
night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is expected today, and Nicole is forecast
to become a hurricane near the northwestern Bahamas and remain a
hurricane when it reaches the east coast of Florida tonight.  Nicole
is expected to weaken while moving across Florida and the
southeastern United States Thursday through Friday, and it is likely
to become a post-tropical cyclone by Friday night over the
Mid-Atlantic states.
 
Nicole is a large tropical storm.  Tropical-storm-force winds
extend outward up to 460 miles (740 km) especially to the north of
the center. A station at Bakers Bay on Great Guana Cay recently 
reported sustained winds of 44 mph (71 km/h) and a wind gust of 63 
mph (101 km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure based on NOAA and Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter data is 986 mb (29.12 inches).
