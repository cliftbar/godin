## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1000 AM EST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Nicole
was located near latitude 34.2 North, longitude 84.3 West. The
depression is moving toward the north-northeast near 23 mph (37
km/h). A faster north-northeast motion is expected this afternoon.
On the forecast track, the center of Nicole will continue to move
over the southern Appalachians during the next few hours.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts.
Nicole is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone later today,
and the cyclone is likely to dissipate tonight. However, Nicole's
remnants will continue to move northeastward across the eastern
United States through Saturday morning.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface 
observations is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
