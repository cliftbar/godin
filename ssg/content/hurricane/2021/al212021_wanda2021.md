## Official Advisory Discussion
At 900 AM GMT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Wanda was
located near latitude 41.8 North, longitude 38.0 West.  Wanda is
moving toward the east-southeast near 6 mph (9 km/h).  A turn to the
southeast is expected today, followed by a southward motion on
Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength or slight strengthening is expected
through this weekend.  Wanda is expected to become an extratropical
cyclone in a few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).
