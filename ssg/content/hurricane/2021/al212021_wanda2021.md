## Official Advisory Discussion
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Wanda was
located near latitude 37.0 North, longitude 37.8 West. Wanda is
moving toward the east near 3 mph (6 km/h).  Wanda is expected to
turn northeastward at a faster forward speed tonight, and a fast
motion toward the northeast is expected Sunday through Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is possible through Sunday.  After that time, 
Wanda is expected to merge with a frontal system Sunday night
and dissipate Monday or Monday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
