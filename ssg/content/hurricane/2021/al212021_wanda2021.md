## Official Advisory Discussion
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Wanda was
located near latitude 34.2 North, longitude 42.2 West. Wanda is
moving toward the east-northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this 
general motion should continue through early this evening.  
A turn toward the northeast is forecast to occur tonight, followed 
by a turn toward the north by Tuesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some slight strengthening will be possible during the next couple of 
days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
