## Official Advisory Discussion
At 900 AM GMT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Wanda was 
located near latitude 37.4 North, longitude 38.3 West. Wanda is 
moving toward the south near 5 mph (7 km/h), and this general motion 
with a further decrease in forward speed is expected to continue 
this morning. A sharp turn toward the northeast is forecast to occur 
by this afternoon, followed by acceleration toward the northeast 
tonight, with that motion continuing on Sunday and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is expected during the next couple of 
days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center, mainly in the western semicircle.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
