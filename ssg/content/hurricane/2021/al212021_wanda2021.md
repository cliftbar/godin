## Official Advisory Discussion
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Wanda was
located near latitude 41.9 North, longitude 39.6 West. Wanda is
moving toward the north near 6 mph (9 km/h).  A slow eastward
motion is forecast by tonight, followed by a faster south-
southeastward to southward motion by Friday and Friday night.
 
Recent satellite wind data indicate that maximum sustained winds
are now near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.  Little change in
strength is expected through Friday, with some slow strengthening
expected Friday night and Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).
