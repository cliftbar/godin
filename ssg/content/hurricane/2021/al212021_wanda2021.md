## Official Advisory Discussion
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Wanda was
located near latitude 39.8 North, longitude 39.5 West. Wanda is
moving toward the north near 10 mph (17 km/h),  and this general
motion should continue through early Thursday. A brief slowdown with
a sharp turn to the southeast is forecast by Thursday night, 
followed by a southward acceleration on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some slight strengthening is forecast during the next couple of 
days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
