## Official Advisory Discussion
At 300 AM GMT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Wanda was 
located near latitude 38.0 North, longitude 38.1 West.  Wanda is 
moving toward the south near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A decrease in forward 
speed is expected this morning, followed by a turn toward the 
northeast later today and a faster northeastward motion on Sunday 
and Monday.
 
Satellite-derived wind data indicate that maximum sustained winds 
remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.  Little change in 
strength is expected during the next couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center, mainly in the western semicircle.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
