## Official Advisory Discussion
At 200 PM CVT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Twenty 
was located near latitude 8.3 North, longitude 24.6 West. The 
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 
km/h), and this motion is expected to continue during the next 
couple of days, followed by a turn to the northwest.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Steady strengthening is forecast, and the depression is expected to 
become a tropical storm tonight and a hurricane in a couple of days.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
