## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Victor
was located near latitude 17.1 North, longitude 41.3 West.  The
depression is moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), 
and a northwestward or west-northwestward motion is expected over 
the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual weakening is expected during the next couple of days, and 
Victor is forecast to degenerate to a remnant low by Monday and 
dissipate soon thereafter.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
