## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Victor 
was located near latitude 13.7 North, longitude 38.0 West. The 
depression is moving toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h), and 
this general motion is expected to continue over the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Gradual weakening is forecast over the next couple of days, and 
Victor could become a remnant low during that time. The system is 
then forecast to dissipate by Tuesday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
