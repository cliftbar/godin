## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Victor was
located near latitude 10.6 North, longitude 30.7 West. Victor is
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A
west-northwest to northwest motion over the eastern tropical
Atlantic is expected through the weekend.

Recent satellite wind data indicate that maximum sustained winds 
are now near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.  Gradual 
strengthening is forecast during the next day or so.  However, a 
weakening trend is expected to begin over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
mainly to the northeast of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
