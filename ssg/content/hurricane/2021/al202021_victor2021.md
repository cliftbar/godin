## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Victor was
located near latitude 12.3 North, longitude 35.3 West. Victor is
moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h) and this
general motion is expected to continue with a gradual turn more
northwest over the next several days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with
higher gusts. Additional weakening is forecast during the next few
days, and Victor is now forecast to become a remnant low Monday
night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
