## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Victor
was located near latitude 16.1 North, longitude 39.9 West. The
depression is moving toward the northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h) and
this general motion is expected to continue over the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some fluctuations in intensity could occur today. However, gradual 
weakening is forecast to begin by tonight and continue for the next 
few days, with Victor becoming a remnant low during that time. The 
system is forecast to dissipate by Tuesday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
