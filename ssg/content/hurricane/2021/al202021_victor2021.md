## Official Advisory Discussion
At 200 PM CVT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Victor was
located near latitude 9.5 North, longitude 28.9 West.  Victor is
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A
west-northwest to northwest motion over the eastern tropical
Atlantic is expected through the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Gradual strengthening is forecast, and Victor could be near 
hurricane strength on Friday.  A weakening trend is expected to 
begin over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
north of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
