## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Victor
was located near latitude 18.1 North, longitude 43.6 West.  The
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h)
and this general motion is expected to continued through today.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased near 30 mph (45 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Further weakening is forecast, and Victor is expected 
to become a remnant low later today and dissipate by Tuesday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1009 mb (29.80 inches).
