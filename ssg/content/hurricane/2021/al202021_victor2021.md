## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Victor was
located near latitude 12.0 North, longitude 34.3 West. Victor is
moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). The forward 
speed of the tropical storm has slowed and a turn to the northwest 
is anticipated by tomorrow. Victor is then expected to move 
northwestward over the weekend and into early next week with 
slight fluctuations in forward speed.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Victor is expected to gradually weaken over the next 72 
hours. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
