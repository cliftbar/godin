## Official Advisory Discussion
At 800 AM CVT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Victor was
located near latitude 8.7 North, longitude 27.3 West.  Victor is
moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A 
west-northwest to northwest motion over the eastern tropical 
Atlantic is expected through the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast, and 
Victor could become a hurricane on Friday.  A weakening trend is 
expected to begin over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
