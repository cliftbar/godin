## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 16.8 North, longitude 53.2 West. Sam is moving toward
the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this motion is expected to
continue for the next few days, with an increase in forward speed 
beginning on Thursday.  A turn to the north is expected by Friday.
On the forecast track, Sam will pass well to the northeast of the
northern Leeward Islands Wednesday and Thursday.
 
Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter plane indicate that maximum 
sustained winds remain near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher gusts.  
Sam is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind 
Scale.  The hurricane could strengthen some overnight, and Sam is 
anticipated to be a category 3 or 4 hurricane for the next several 
days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure from NOAA aircraft data is 
956 mb (28.23 inches).
