## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 52.7 West. Sam is moving toward
the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this motion is expected to
continue for the next few days, with an increase in forward speed
beginning on Thursday.  A turn to the north is expected by Friday.
On the forecast track, Sam will pass well to the northeast of the
northern Leeward Islands Wednesday and Thursday.
 
An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicates that the 
maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Sam is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some strengthening is expected through 
tonight. Thereafter, fluctuations in intensity are possible through 
Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).
 
The minimum central pressure measured by the aircraft is 957 mb 
(28.26 inches).
