## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Sam was located near 
latitude 17.5 North, longitude 54.3 West. Sam is moving toward the 
northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h) and this motion with an increase in 
forward is expected during the next couple of days.  A turn toward 
the north is forecast to occur by Friday.  On the forecast track, 
Sam will pass well to the east of the northern Leeward Islands 
through Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.   Some fluctuations in intensity are expected 
during the next couple of days, but Sam is forecast to remain a 
major hurricane through late this week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 952 mb (28.12 inches).
