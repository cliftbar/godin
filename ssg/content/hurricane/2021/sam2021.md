## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 19.4 North, longitude 57.0 West.  Sam is moving toward
the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion with an
increase in forward speed is expected during the next couple of
days.  A turn toward the north is forecast by Friday.  On the
forecast track, Sam will pass well to the east-northeast of the 
northern Leeward Islands through tonight.

Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are expected
during the next couple of days, but Sam is forecast to remain a
major hurricane through late this week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 949 mb (28.03 inches).
