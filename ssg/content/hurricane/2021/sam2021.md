## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Sam was located by 
an Air Force Reserve Unit Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 
17.9 North, longitude 55.0 West.  Sam is moving toward the northwest 
near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion with an increase in
forward speed is expected during the next couple of days.  A turn 
toward the north is forecast by Friday.  On the forecast track, Sam 
will pass well to the east or northeast of the northern Leeward 
Islands through Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are expected 
during the next couple of days, but Sam is forecast to remain a 
major hurricane through late this week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft observations is 947 mb (27.97 inches).
