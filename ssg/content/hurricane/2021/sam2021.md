## Official Advisory Disucssion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 13.3 North, longitude 48.5 West. Sam is moving toward
the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A slower motion to the
west-northwest is expected over the weekend, followed by a turn to
the northwest on Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near near 140 mph
(220 km/h) with higher gusts.  Sam is now a category 4 hurricane on
the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional strengthening
is expected through tonight. Some fluctuations in the hurricane's
intensity are then possible early next week.
 
Sam remains a small hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend
outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the center and
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 943 mb (27.85 inches).
