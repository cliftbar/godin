## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Sam was located near 
latitude 26.6 North, longitude 61.7 West.  Sam is moving toward
the north-northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h).  A turn toward the north 
and north-northeast, at a similar forward speed, is expected later 
today and tonight, followed by a northeastward motion Saturday 
night through Monday.  On the forecast track, the center of Sam 
will pass well to the east of Bermuda tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 150 mph (240 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Although fluctuations in intensity are 
still possible today, weakening is forecast during the next couple 
of days.  However, Sam is expected to remain a major hurricane 
through at least Saturday night.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175
miles (280 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on data from an Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 934 mb (27.58 inches).
