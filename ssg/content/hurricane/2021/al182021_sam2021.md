## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 31.4 North, longitude 61.2 West. Sam is now moving 
toward the north-northeast near 17 mph (28 km/h).  A turn toward 
the northeast is expected by Saturday night, with this motion 
continuing through Monday.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Sam will pass well to the east of Bermuda during the next several 
hours.
 
Maximum sustained winds are now near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Although fluctuations in intensity are still
possible, weakening is forecast during the next couple of days.
However, Sam is expected to remain a major hurricane into Sunday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles
(335 km).  Several automated stations on Bermuda have recently 
reported wind gusts of 40 to 45 mph (65 to 75 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 940 mb (27.76 inches).
