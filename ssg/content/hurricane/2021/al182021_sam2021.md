## Official Advisory Discussion
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Sam was located near
latitude 22.1 North, longitude 59.5 West.  Sam is moving toward the
northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general motion with an
increase in forward speed is expected through tonight.  A turn
toward the north is anticipated by late Friday, and a northeastward
motion is forecast to begin on Saturday.  On the forecast track, the
core of Sam will continue to pass well to the northeast of the
northern Leeward Islands this morning, and pass to the east of
Bermuda early Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are expected
during the next couple of days, but Sam is forecast to remain a
major hurricane through Saturday, with more significant weakening
anticipated later in the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 937 mb (27.67 inches).
