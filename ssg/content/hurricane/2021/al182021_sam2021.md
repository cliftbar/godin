## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 37.3 North, longitude 55.9 West.  Sam is moving toward
the northeast near 17 mph (28 km/h).  This general motion with an
increase in forward speed is expected during the next few days.  On
the forecast track, Sam will move over the far North Atlantic well 
to southeast and east of Newfoundland.
 
Maximum sustained winds decreased to near 105 mph (165 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Further weakening is forecast during the next few 
days, and Sam is expected transition into a powerful post-tropical 
cyclone on Monday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles
(390 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches).
