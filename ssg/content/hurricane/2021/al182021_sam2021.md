## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 40.8 North, longitude 48.7 West. Sam is moving toward
the northeast near 30 mph (48 km/h). A northeastward motion at
a faster forward speed is expected over the next couple of days. The
cyclone is forecast to slow down over the far north Atlantic
southwest of Iceland around midweek.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next few days, and 
Sam is expected to transition into a powerful post-tropical cyclone 
by early Tuesday.
 
Sam is a large hurricane. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up 
to 70 miles (110 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds 
extend outward up to 255 miles (405 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 957 mb (28.26 inches).
