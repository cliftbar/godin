## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 20.6 North, longitude 58.4 West. Sam is moving toward
the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general motion with an
increase in forward speed is expected during the next couple of
days.  A turn toward the north and northeast is anticipated by
Friday night.  On the forecast track, Sam will continue to pass well
to the east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands through
tonight, and pass to the east of Bermuda early Saturday.
 
Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that maximum
sustained winds have increased to near 145 mph (230 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are expected
during the next couple of days, but Sam is forecast to remain a
major hurricane through late this week, with more significant
weakening anticipated over the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 65 miles (100 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on NOAA Hurricane 
Hunter data is 940 mb (27.76 inches).
