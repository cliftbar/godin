## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 30.0 North, longitude 61.8 West. Sam is moving toward
the north near 20 mph (31 km/h).  A turn toward the north-northeast,
at a slightly slower forward speed, is expected by tonight, followed
by a northeastward motion Saturday night through Monday.  On the
forecast track, the center of Sam will pass well to the east of
Bermuda tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 150 mph (240 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Although fluctuations in intensity are still 
possible, weakening is forecast during the next couple of days.  
However, Sam is expected to remain a major hurricane through at 
least Saturday night.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles
(335 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 937 mb (27.67 inches).
