## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 42.6 North, longitude 45.7 West. Sam is moving toward
the northeast near 32 mph (52 km/h). A faster northeastward motion 
is expected through tonight. A slower east-northeastward motion is 
forecast to begin on Tuesday and continue through midweek. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next few days, and
Sam is expected to transition into a powerful post-tropical cyclone
over the north Atlantic tonight or early Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275 miles
(445 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches).
