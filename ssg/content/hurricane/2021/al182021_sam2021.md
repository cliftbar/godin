## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 22.6 North, longitude 60.0 West. Sam is moving toward
the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and a turn toward the 
north-northwest with an increase in forward speed is expected 
tonight.  A turn toward the north is anticipated by late Friday, and 
a northeastward motion is forecast to begin on Saturday.  On the 
forecast track, the core of Sam will pass to the east of Bermuda 
early Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are expected
during the next couple of days, but Sam is forecast to remain a
major hurricane through Saturday, with more significant weakening
anticipated later in the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 937 mb (27.67 inches).
