## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 36.4 North, longitude 57.1 West. Sam is moving toward
the northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h). This general track with an
increase in forward speed is expected for the next few days.  On 
the forecast track, Sam will move well southeast and east of 
Newfoundland over the North Atlantic.
 
Maximum sustained winds are now near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Further slow weakening is anticipated during 
the next few days, and Sam could transition into a powerful 
post-tropical cyclone on Monday night.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240
miles (390 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 955 mb (28.20 inches).
