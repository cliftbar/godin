## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Sam was located 
near latitude 39.3 North, longitude 51.2 West. Sam is moving toward
the northeast near 20 mph (31 km/h). A northeastward motion at
a faster forward speed is expected over the next couple of days. The
cyclone is forecast to slow down over the far north Atlantic 
southwest of Iceland around midweek.
 
Satellite images indicate that maximum sustained winds have 
increased to near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher gusts.  Gradual 
weakening is forecast during the next few days, and Sam is expected 
to transition into a powerful post-tropical cyclone by early 
Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240
miles (390 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 957 mb (28.26 inches).
