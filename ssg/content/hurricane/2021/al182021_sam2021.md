## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located 
near latitude 38.6 North, longitude 52.8 West. Sam is moving toward 
the east-northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h). A northeastward motion at 
a faster forward speed is expected over the next couple of days. The 
cyclone is forecast to slow down over the north Atlantic around 
midweek.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next few days, and
Sam is expected to transition into a powerful post-tropical cyclone
by late Monday.
 
Sam is a large tropical cyclone. Hurricane-force winds extend 
outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 964 mb (28.47 inches).
