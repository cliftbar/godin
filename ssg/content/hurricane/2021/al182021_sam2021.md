## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 35.4 North, longitude 58.2 West. Sam is moving toward
the northeast near 17 mph (28 km/h). This general track with an
increase in forward speed is expected by Monday for the next few 
days.  On the forecast track, Sam will move well southeast of 
Newfoundland over the North Atlantic.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 125 mph (205 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Sam is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Further slow weakening is 
anticipated during the next few days, and Sam could transition into 
a powerful post-tropical cyclone on Tuesday.
 
Sam is a large tropical cyclone. Hurricane-force winds extend 
outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 950 mb (28.06 inches).
