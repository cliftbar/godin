## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Sam was located near 
latitude 32.8 North, longitude 60.5 West.  Sam is moving toward
the north-northeast near 17 mph (28 km/h), and this motion is
expected to continue today.  A turn toward the northeast is 
expected by tonight, with an increase in forward speed forecast 
through Monday.  On the forecast track, Sam will continue to move 
away from Bermuda.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 130 mph (215 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional weakening is 
forecast during the next few days, but Sam is expected to remain a 
major hurricane through today or tonight.  Sam is likely to become 
a hurricane-force post-tropical low by Monday night or early 
Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 65 miles (100 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km).  Several automated stations on Bermuda have recently 
reported wind gusts near 40 mph (65 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 945 mb (27.91 inches).
