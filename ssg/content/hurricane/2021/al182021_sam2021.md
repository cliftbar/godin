## Official Advisory Discussion
At 300 AM GMT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 47.7 North, longitude 40.2 West. Sam is moving toward
the north-northeast near 29 mph (46 km/h).  This general motion
should continue overnight with a decrease in forward speed.  A
slow east-northeastward motion is forecast to begin by late today,
and a northeastward motion is expected Wednesday and Wednesday
night.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 85 mph (140 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Although gradual weakening is forecast during
the next few days, Sam is expected to transition into a powerful
post-tropical cyclone over the north Atlantic within the next 6-12
hours.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 460
miles (740 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 965 mb (28.50 inches).
