## Official Advisory Discussion
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 45.1 North, longitude 42.5 West. Sam is moving toward
the northeast near 36 mph (57 km/h).  This general motion should 
continue tonight. A slower east-northeastward motion is forecast to 
begin by late Tuesday, and a northeastward motion is expected 
Wednesday and Wednesday night. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts. Although gradual weakening is forecast during the next few 
days, Sam is expected to transition into a powerful post-tropical 
cyclone over the north Atlantic tonight.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275
miles (445 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 965 mb (28.50 inches).
