## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 33.9 North, longitude 59.3 West. Sam is moving toward
the northeast near 17 mph (28 km/h).  This general track with an
increase in forward speed is expected for the next few days.  On
the forecast track, Sam will continue to move away from Bermuda.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some slow weakening is forecast during the
next 36 hours, followed by more significant weakening early next
week.  Sam could become a powerful post-tropical cyclone on Tuesday.
 
Sam is becoming a large tropical cyclone.  Hurricane-force winds 
extend outward up to 65 miles (100 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 945 mb (27.91 inches).
