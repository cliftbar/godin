## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ophelia was 
located near latitude 36.8 North, longitude 77.3 West. Ophelia is 
moving toward the north near 12 mph (19 km/h). A gradual turn toward 
the northeast is expected by tomorrow. On the forecast track, the 
center of Ophelia is expected to continue moving over southeastern 
Virginia through tonight, and then over the Delmarva Peninsula by 
tomorrow.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Additional weakening is expected, and Ophelia is likely to become a 
post-tropical cyclone tomorrow.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310 miles (500 km) 
from the center. A WeatherFlow station in Pamlico Sound recently 
reported a sustained wind of 37 mph (59 km/h), with a gust up to 43 
mph (69 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ophelia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1, WMO header WTNT41 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Hatteras Inlet, NC to Duck, NC...2-4 ft
James and York Rivers...2-4 ft
Rappahannock River...2-4 ft
Lower Potomac River...2-4 ft
Duck, NC to Manasquan Inlet, NJ...1-3 ft
Upper Chesapeake Bay...1-3 ft
Delaware Bay...1-3 ft
Surf City NC, NC to Hatteras Inlet, NC...1-2 ft
Neuse and Bay Rivers...1-2 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...1-2 ft
Albemarle and Pamlico Sound...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by dangerous
waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the
surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue to affect portions 
of the coast of North Carolina and southeastern Virginia within the 
warning area through this evening.
 
RAINFALL:  Ophelia is expected to produce the following additional 
rainfall through Sunday night:
 
Portions of the Mid-Atlantic from north central North Carolina
through New Jersey...1 to 3 inches with isolated higher totals up
to 5 inches.
 
Across southeastern New York through southern New England...1 to 3
inches.
 
This rainfall may produce locally considerable flash, urban, and
small stream flooding impacts, particularly across the Mid Atlantic
region from North Carolina to New Jersey. Isolated river flooding is
possible in areas of heavier rainfall.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ophelia will continue to affect much of 
the east coast of the United States through the weekend.  These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two may occur through tonight across parts 
of the Mid-Atlantic Coast.
