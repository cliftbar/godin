## Official Advisory Discussion
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ophelia was 
located near latitude 32.7 North, longitude 76.0 West. Ophelia is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). This 
general motion is expected to continue during the next day or so, 
followed by a slight turn toward the north. On the forecast track, 
the center of Ophelia will approach the coast of North Carolina 
tonight, and then move across eastern North Carolina, southeastern 
Virginia, and the Delmarva Peninsula Saturday and Sunday.
 
Data from the Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters and satellite wind 
data indicate that maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 
mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. Some slight strengthening is 
possible before landfall along the coast of North Carolina.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275 miles (445 km) 
from the center. NOAA buoy 41025 at Diamond Shoals, North Carolina, 
recently reported a sustained wind of 47 mph (76 km/h) and a gust of 
60 mph (97 km/h). A NOAA C-MAN station at Cape Lookout, North 
Carolina, recently reported a sustained wind of 45 mph (72 km/h) and 
a gust of 52 mph (83 km/h).  
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.29 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ophelia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1, WMO header WTNT41 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Neuse and Bay Rivers...3-5 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...3-5 ft
Chesapeake Bay south of Colonial Beach...2-4 ft
Surf City, NC to Chincoteague, VA...2-4 ft
Albemarle Sound...2-4 ft
South Santee River, SC to Surf City, NC...1-3 ft
Chincoteague, VA to Manasquan Inlet, NJ...1-3 ft
Upper Chesapeake Bay...1-3 ft
Delaware Bay...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by dangerous
waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the
surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are affecting portions of the North 
Carolina coast within the warning area and will continue spreading 
northward through Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  Ophelia is forecast to produce 3 to 5 inches of rainfall, 
with localized amounts of 7 inches across portions of eastern North 
Carolina and southeast Virginia from today into Saturday. Across 
remaining portions of the Mid-Atlantic into southern New England, 2 
to 4 inches of rainfall are forecast from later today into Sunday.  
This rainfall may produce flash, urban, and small stream flooding 
impacts.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ophelia will affect much of the east
coast of the United States through this weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible beginning tonight through
Saturday for portions of the mid-Atlantic Coast.
