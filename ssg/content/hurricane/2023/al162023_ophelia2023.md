## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ophelia was 
located near latitude 35.6 North, longitude 77.2 West. Ophelia is 
moving toward the north near 13 mph (20 km/h). A continued northward 
motion is expected today, followed by a gradual turn toward the 
northeast by Sunday. On the forecast track, the center of Ophelia 
will continue moving across eastern North Carolina over southeastern 
Virginia over the remainder of today, and over the Delmarva 
Peninsula by tonight into Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Further weakening is expected through the remainder of the weekend, 
and Ophelia is likely to become a post-tropical cyclone by Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 320 miles (520 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.24 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ophelia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1, WMO header WTNT41 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Neuse and Bay Rivers...3-5 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...3-5 ft
Chesapeake Bay south of Colonial Beach...2-4 ft
Ocracoke Inlet, NC to Chincoteague, VA...2-4 ft
Albemarle Sound...2-4 ft
Chincoteague, VA to Manasquan Inlet, NJ...1-3 ft
Upper Chesapeake Bay...1-3 ft
Delaware Bay...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by dangerous
waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the
surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are affecting portions of the coast
of North Carolina and southeastern Virginia within the warning area
and will continue spreading northward today.
 
RAINFALL:
Ophelia is expected to produce the following storm total rainfall:
 
Portions of eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia...3 to 5
inches with isolated higher totals of 8 inches through tonight.
 
Across the remaining portions of the Mid Atlantic...2 to 4 inches
through Sunday.
 
Across southern New York through southern New England...1 to 3
inches through Monday morning.
 
This rainfall may produce locally considerable flash, urban, and
small stream flooding impacts, particularly across the Mid Atlantic
region from North Carolina to New Jersey. Isolated river flooding is
possible in areas of heavier rainfall.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ophelia will affect much of the east
coast of the United States through this weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two may occur today over parts of the
Mid-Atlantic Coast.
