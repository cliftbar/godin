## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ophelia was
located near latitude 33.6 North, longitude 76.8 West.  Ophelia is
moving toward the north-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A turn 
toward the north is forecast on Saturday, followed by a turn toward 
the northeast on Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Ophelia will reach the coast of North Carolina early Saturday, and 
then move across eastern North Carolina, southeastern Virginia, and 
the Delmarva Peninsula Saturday and Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast before landfall along
the coast of North Carolina.  Weakening is expected after landfall
through the rest of the weekend, and Ophelia is likely to become 
extratropical by Saturday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310 miles (500 km)
from the center.  NOAA buoy 41013 at Frying Pan Shoals recently 
reported a sustained wind of 51 mph (83 km/h) and a gust to 71 mph 
(115 km/h).  An observation at Poquoson River Light in Virginia 
reported a sustained wind of 43 mph (69 km/h) and a gust to 54 mph 
(87 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 984 mb (29.06 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ophelia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1, WMO header WTNT41 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Neuse and Bay Rivers...4-6 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...4-6 ft
Chesapeake Bay south of Colonial Beach...2-4 ft
Surf City, NC to Chincoteague, VA...2-4 ft
Albemarle Sound...2-4 ft
South Santee River, SC to Surf City, NC...1-3 ft
Chincoteague, VA to Manasquan Inlet, NJ...1-3 ft
Upper Chesapeake Bay...1-3 ft
Delaware Bay...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by dangerous
waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the
surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are affecting portions of the 
coast of North Carolina and southeastern Virginia within the 
warning area and will continue spreading northward through Saturday. 
Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area early 
Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  Ophelia is expected to produce the following rainfall:
 
Across portions of eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia...3
to 5 inches with isolated higher totals around 7 inches into Sunday
morning.
 
Across the remaining portions of the Mid Atlantic...2 to 4 inches
tonight through Sunday.
 
Across southern New York through southern New England...1 to 3
inches Saturday into Monday.
 
This rainfall may produce locally considerable flash, urban, and
small stream flooding impacts, particularly across the Mid Atlantic
region from North Carolina to New Jersey. Isolated river flooding is
possible in areas of heavier rainfall.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ophelia will affect much of the east
coast of the United States through this weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible Saturday for portions of
the mid-Atlantic coast.
