## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nigel was
located near latitude 24.0 North, longitude 49.1 West. Nigel is
moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). This general
motion is forecast to continue for the next couple of days. Nigel is
then forecast to turn northward by late Tuesday and accelerate
northeastward after that.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Additional strengthening is expected and Nigel will 
likely become a hurricane tonight or on Monday. Nigel is forecast to 
approach major hurricane intensity by mid-week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
