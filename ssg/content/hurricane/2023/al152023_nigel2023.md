## Official Advisory Discussion
At 300 AM GMT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Nigel was located
near latitude 45.1 North, longitude 36.7 West. Nigel is moving
toward the east-northeast near 37 mph (59 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue for the next day or so.  A slower
northward or north-northwestward motion is expected this weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Weakening is forecast during the next couple of 
days, and Nigel is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone 
tonight or early Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230
miles (370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
