## Official Advisory Discussion
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Nigel was located
near latitude 43.7 North, longitude 40.8 West. Nigel is moving
toward the east-northeast near 37 mph (59 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue for the next day or so.  A slower 
northward or north-northwestward motion is expected this weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Weakening is forecast during the next couple of days, and
Nigel is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone tonight or
early Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km).
