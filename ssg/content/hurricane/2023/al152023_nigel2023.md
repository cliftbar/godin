## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Nigel was located
near latitude 40.6 North, longitude 47.8 West. Nigel is moving
toward the northeast near 30 mph (48 km/h) and this motion is
expected to continue the next day or two.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts. Weakening is forecast during the next couple of days, and
Nigel is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone by Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 977 mb (28.85 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Nigel currently affecting Bermuda will
gradually subside through tonight.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
