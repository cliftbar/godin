## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Nigel was located
near latitude 30.5 North, longitude 54.3 West.  Nigel is moving
toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  The hurricane is
forecast to turn northward late today, and then accelerate rapidly
northeastward through the rest of the week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 90 mph (150 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Nigel could strengthen some more through early
Wednesday, but weakening is likely on Thursday and Friday.  Nigel
is forecast to become a strong post-tropical cyclone on Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 975 mb (28.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Nigel are expected to reach Bermuda
later today.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
