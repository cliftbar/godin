## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Sean was 
located near latitude 14.6 North, longitude 41.7 West. Sean is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). A turn 
toward the northwest at a similar forward speed is expected today. 
Sean is then expected to gradually slow down, turning back toward 
the west-northwest by Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Additional weakening is anticipated. Sean will likely 
become a post-tropical remnant low over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
