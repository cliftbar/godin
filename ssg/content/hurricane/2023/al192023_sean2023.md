## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Sean was 
located near latitude 14.9 North, longitude 42.5 West. Sean is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). A turn 
toward the northwest is expected later this evening, and this motion 
should continue for the next day or so. Sean is then expected to 
turn back toward the west-northwest by Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Additional weakening is anticipated. Sean will likely become a 
post-tropical remnant low over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
