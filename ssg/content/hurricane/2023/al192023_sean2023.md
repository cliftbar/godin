## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Sean
was located near latitude 16.0 North, longitude 44.2 West. The
depression is moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A
northwestward motion will continue through today, with a turn
back toward the west-northwest on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have weakened to near 35 mph (55 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Additional weakening is anticipated, and Sean will 
likely become a post-tropical remnant low on Sunday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
