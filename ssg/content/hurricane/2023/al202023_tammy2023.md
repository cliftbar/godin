## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located
near latitude 15.2 North, longitude 60.4 West.  Tammy is now moving
toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion
is expected to continue through tonight.  A turn toward the
north-northwest is forecast on Sunday, followed by a turn toward
the north on Monday.  On the forecast track, the center of Tammy
will move near or over portions of the Leeward Islands through
early Sunday, and then move north of the northern Leeward Islands
by Sunday afternoon.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Fluctuations in intensity are possible during the next few
days, but Tammy is expected to remain a hurricane while it passes
near or over the Leeward Islands.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.27 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tammy can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to begin in the hurricane
warning area later this morning and spread northward across the
Leeward Islands today and tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected within the tropical storm warning areas today and tonight.
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch areas
today and tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are possible on
Martinique today and the British Virgin Islands tonight and Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: Tammy is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall:
 
Leeward Islands: 4 to 8 inches with maximum amounts of 12 inches.
 
Portions of the Windward Islands: 2 to 4 inches with maximum amounts
of 6 inches.
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands into eastern Puerto Rico: 1 to 2
inches with maximum amounts of 4 inches.
 
These rains may produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along
with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above normal tide levels near where the center of Tammy
moves across the Leeward Islands.  Near the coast, the surge will
be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Lesser Antilles during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
