## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Tammy was
located near latitude 14.0 North, longitude 58.3 West.  Tammy is
moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this
general motion is expected to continue through this afternoon.  A 
turn toward the northwest is anticipated by this evening, followed 
by a north-northwestward and northward turn Saturday night through 
Sunday night.  On the forecast track, the center of Tammy will move 
near or over portions of the Leeward Islands tonight and on 
Saturday, and then move north of the northern Leeward Islands on 
Sunday.
 
Data from a recent Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter mission 
indicate that maximum sustained winds remain near 60 mph (95 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Gradual strengthening is forecast during the 
next few days, and Tammy is expected to be at or near hurricane 
intensity while it moves near or over portions of the Leeward 
Islands.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data is 1000 mb 
(29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical
storm warning area beginning later today and tonight.  Hurricane

Saturday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the
tropical storm watch area beginning later today.
 
RAINFALL: Tammy is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall:
 
Leeward Islands: 4 to 8 inches with maximum amounts of 12 inches
 
Northern Windward Islands: 2 to 4 inches with maximum amounts of 6
inches
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands into eastern Puerto Rico: 1 to 2

These rains may produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along
with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above normal tide levels near where the center of Tammy
moves across the Leeward Islands.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Lesser Antilles during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
