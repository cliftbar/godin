## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located
near latitude 25.6 North, longitude 60.2 West. Tammy is moving
toward the northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h). A northward turn is
expected later today, followed by a slower northwestward motion on
Thursday and Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 100 mph (155 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is possible today, 
followed by weakening through late this week. Tammy is forecast to 
become a powerful post-tropical cyclone by Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 969 mb (28.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto
Rico during the next couple of days. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
