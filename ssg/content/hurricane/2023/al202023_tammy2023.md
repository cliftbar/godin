## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Tammy was
located near latitude 33.0 North, longitude 60.1 West. Tammy is
moving toward the northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h). This northeast
motion will continue through this afternoon, followed by a faster
eastward to east-southeastward motion tonight through Monday. On the
forecast track, Tammy will continue to move away from Bermuda today.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h)
with higher gusts. Weakening is expected during the next few days,
and Tammy is forecast to become a post-tropical remnant low early
next week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect Bermuda
through tonight. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
