HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tammy can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Tammy is expected to produce an additional 1 to 3 inches 
of rainfall across portions of the British Virgin Islands, the 
Leeward Islands, and the northern Windward Islands through this 
morning, bringing storm total maximum amounts to 12 inches in the 
Leeward Islands.  These rains may produce isolated flash and urban 
flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of 
the Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto 
Rico during the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
