WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area beginning on Friday.
 
RAINFALL:  Through Saturday night, Tammy is expected to produce
storm total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches, with maximum amounts of 10
inches, across portions of the northern Windward into the Leeward
Islands.  Rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches with maximum amounts of
4 inches are expected for the British and U.S. Virgin Islands into

urban flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher
terrain.

the Lesser Antilles later today.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
