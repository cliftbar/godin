HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tammy can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Tammy is expected to produce an additional 1 to 3 inches
of rainfall across portions of the British Virgin Islands, the
Leeward Islands, and the northern Windward Islands into Monday
morning, bringing storm total maximum amounts to 12 inches in the
Leeward Islands.  These rains may produce isolated flash and urban
flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Lesser Antilles during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
