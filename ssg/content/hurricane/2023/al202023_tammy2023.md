near latitude 17.8 North, longitude 61.9 West. Tammy is moving
toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h) and this general
motion is expected through Sunday, followed by a turn toward the
north on Monday.  On the forecast track, the center of Tammy will
move north of the northern Leeward Islands by Sunday afternoon.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some slight strengthening is possible during the next 
couple of days.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tammy can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected over portions of the
northern Leeward Islands tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected within the tropical storm warning areas through tonight.
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the British Virgin Islands
tonight and Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: Tammy is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall:
 
Leeward Islands: 4 to 8 inches with storm total maximum amounts of
12 inches
 
Martinique and Dominica: Additional 2 to 4 inches, storm total
maximum 6 inches
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands into eastern Puerto Rico: 1 to 2
inches with maximum storm total amounts of 4 inches
 
These rains may produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along
with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above normal tide levels near where the center of Tammy
moves across the Leeward Islands.  Near the coast, the surge will
be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Lesser Antilles during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
