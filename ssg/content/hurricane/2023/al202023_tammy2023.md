## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Tammy was 
located near latitude 13.8 North, longitude 57.1 West. Tammy is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A gradual 
turn to the northwest with some additional slowdown is forecast on 
Friday, and this motion should continue through Saturday.  A more 
northward motion is forecast to begin Saturday night or Sunday.  On 
the forecast track, the center of Tammy will move near or over the 
Leeward Islands Friday and Saturday, and then move north of the 
Leeward Islands Saturday night and Sunday.
 
Data from the NOAA reconnaissance aircraft indicate that the maximum 
sustained winds remain near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Gradual strengthening is expected to begin on Friday and continue 
into this weekend. Tammy is forecast to be at or near hurricane 
intensity when it moves near the Leeward Islands Friday night and 
Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
