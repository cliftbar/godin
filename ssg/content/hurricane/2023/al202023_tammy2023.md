## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located
near latitude 14.1 North, longitude 58.6 West. Tammy is moving
toward the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue through this afternoon.  A turn 
toward the northwest is anticipated by this evening, followed
by a north-northwestward and northward turn Saturday night through
Sunday night.  On the forecast track, the center of Tammy will move
near or over portions of the Leeward Islands tonight and on
Saturday, and then move north of the northern Leeward Islands on
Sunday.
 
Data from NOAA and Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft 
indicate that the maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 
km/h) with higher gusts.  Gradual strengthening is forecast during 
the next couple of days, and Tammy is expected to be a hurricane 
while it moves near or over portions of the Leeward Islands.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from reconnaissance aircraft 
data is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tammy can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical
storm warning area beginning later today or tonight.  Hurricane 
conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area by late 
tonight or early Saturday.  Hurricane conditions are possible in 
the hurricane watch area in the Leeward Islands on Saturday.  
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the tropical storm 
watch area beginning later today.
 
RAINFALL: Tammy is expected to produce the following storm total 
rainfall:

Leeward Islands: 4 to 8 inches with maximum amounts of 12 inches

Northern Windward Islands: 2 to 4 inches with maximum amounts of 6 
inches

British and U.S. Virgin Islands into eastern Puerto Rico: 1 to 2 
inches with maximum amounts of 4 inches

These rains may produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along 
with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain. 
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above normal tide levels near where the center of Tammy
moves across the Leeward Islands.  Near the coast, the surge will 
be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Lesser Antilles during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
