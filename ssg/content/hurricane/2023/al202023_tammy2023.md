## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located 
near latitude 26.6 North, longitude 59.3 West. Tammy is moving 
toward the northeast near 13 mph (20 km/h). A northward turn is 
expected later today, followed by a slower northwestward to 
west-northwestward motion on Thursday and Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 105 mph (165 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Gradual weakening is expected for the next few 
days. Tammy is forecast to become a powerful post-tropical cyclone 
by Thursday. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 965 mb (28.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of 
Bermuda, the northern Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin 
Islands, and Puerto Rico during the next couple of days. These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
