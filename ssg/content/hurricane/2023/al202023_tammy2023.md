## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Tammy 
was located near latitude 30.5 North, longitude 58.4 West. The 
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the north near 12 mph (19 
km/h). The system should begin to move northwestward later this 
morning, followed by a slower west-northwestward motion on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Some weakening is expected during the next few 
days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles
(315 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 973 mb (28.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swell will continue to affect portions of Bermuda, the
northern Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico during the next couple of days. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
