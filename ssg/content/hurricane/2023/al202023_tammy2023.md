## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located 
near latitude 24.6 North, longitude 61.7 West. Tammy is moving 
toward the northeast near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this general motion 
is expected to continue through Wednesday. A turn toward the north 
at a slower forward speed is forecast to begin on Thursday, followed 
by a bend to the northwest on Thursday night or Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Slight strengthening is possible during the next day or so, 
followed by steady weakening. Tammy is forecast to become a 
post-tropical cyclone on Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto
Rico during the next few days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
