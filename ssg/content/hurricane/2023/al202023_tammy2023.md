## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located
near latitude 14.3 North, longitude 59.2 West. Tammy is moving
toward the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h). A turn toward the 
northwest is anticipated by tonight, followed by a 
north-northwestward and northward turn Saturday night through Sunday
night.  On the forecast track, the center of Tammy will move near or
over portions of the Leeward Islands tonight through Saturday 
night, and then move north of the northern Leeward Islands on 
Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next couple of
days, and Tammy is expected to be a hurricane while it moves near or
over portions of the Leeward Islands.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.27 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tammy can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical
storm warning area beginning tonight.  Hurricane conditions are 
expected in the hurricane warning area by late tonight or early 
Saturday.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch 
area in the Leeward Islands on Saturday. Tropical storm conditions 
are possible within the tropical storm watch area beginning tonight.
 
RAINFALL: Tammy is expected to produce the following storm total 
rainfall:

Leeward Islands: 4 to 8 inches with maximum amounts of 12 inches.

Northern Windward Islands: 2 to 4 inches with maximum amounts of 6 
inches.

British and U.S. Virgin Islands into eastern Puerto Rico: 1 to 2 
inches with maximum amounts of 4 inches.

These rains may produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along 
with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain. 
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above normal tide levels near where the center of Tammy
moves across the Leeward Islands.  Near the coast, the surge will
be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Lesser Antilles during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
