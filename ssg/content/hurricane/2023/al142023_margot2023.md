## Official Advisory Discussion
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Margot was located 
near latitude 31.7 North, longitude 39.6 West. Margot is moving 
toward the north near 14 mph (22 km/h). A turn toward the 
north-northwest at a slower forward speed is expected beginning 
tomorrow. A meandering northward motion is then expected on Thursday 
and Friday. Margot's track beyond Friday is unusually uncertain, but 
a slow meandering motion is generally expected into the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts. Slight fluctuations in intensity, up or down, are possible 
during the next several days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 265
miles (425 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 977 mb (28.85 inches).
