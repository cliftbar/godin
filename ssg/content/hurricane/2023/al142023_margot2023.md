## Official Advisory Discussion
At 300 AM GMT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Margot was located
near latitude 28.0 North, longitude 39.6 West. Margot is moving
toward the north near 12 mph (19 km/h), and a northward to 
north-northwestward motion is expected over the next few several 
days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is forecast
during the next 48 hours.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 984 mb (29.06 inches).
