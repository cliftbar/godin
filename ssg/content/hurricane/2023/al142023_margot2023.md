## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Margot was
located near latitude 18.8 North, longitude 34.3 West. Margot is
moving toward the west-northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h), and this
motion is expected to continue the next day or so, followed by a  
decrease in forward motion and a turn northwestward, then northward 
early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some gradual strengthening is forecast the next several days, with 
Margot forecast to become a hurricane early next week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
