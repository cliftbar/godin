## Official Advisory Discussion
At 300 AM GMT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Margot was located 
near latitude 35.2 North, longitude 40.5 West. Margot is moving 
toward the north near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this motion is expected 
to continue with a gradual decrease in forward speed through 
Thursday. Margot is then likely to meander within weak steering 
currents through this weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Steady weakening is forecast over the next few 
days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230
miles (370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).
