## Official Advisory Discussion
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Margot was located
near latitude 36.5 North, longitude 39.8 West. Margot is moving
toward the north-northeast near 6 mph (9 km/h), and a slower
forward motion is expected today. Margot is forecast to meander
within weak steering currents on Friday and make a small clockwise
loop over the weekend.
 
Satellite-wind data indicate that the maximum sustained winds are 
near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher gusts.  Gradual weakening is 
forecast over the next few days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230
miles (370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 978 mb (28.88 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Margot will continue to affect the
Azores for the next several days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
