## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Margot was 
located near latitude 23.0 North, longitude 40.0 West. Margot is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A gradual 
turn to the north is expected during the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Additional strengthening is forecast, and Margot is likely to become 
a hurricane within the next couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
