## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Margot was
located near latitude 21.6 North, longitude 39.1 West.  Margot is
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A gradual turn 
to the north-northwest and north is expected during the next couple 
of days

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast, and 
Margo is likely to become a hurricane within the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
