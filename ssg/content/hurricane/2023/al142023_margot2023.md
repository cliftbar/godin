## Official Advisory Discussion
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Margot was located
near latitude 36.9 North, longitude 39.3 West. Margot is moving
toward the northeast near 5 mph (7 km/h), and this motion is 
expected to slow while Margot undergoes a clockwise loop well to the 
west of the Azores.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and 
Margot should weaken to a tropical storm by Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230
miles (370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 978 mb (28.88 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Margot will continue to affect the
Azores for the next several days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
