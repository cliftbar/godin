## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Margot was
located near latitude 18.0 North, longitude 32.5 West. Margot is
moving toward the west-northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h) and this
motion is expected to continue for the next day or two, with a turn 
towards a more northwestward motion early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast during the next day or so, and 
Margot is forecast to become a hurricane later this weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
