## Official Advisory Discussion
At 200 AM CVT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Margot was 
located near latitude 16.8 North, longitude 29.3 West. Margot is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h). This general 
motion is expected to continue through the weekend, followed by a 
turn toward the northwest early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Gradual strengthening is expected during the next few days, and 
Margot is forecast to become a hurricane over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
