## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Cindy was 
located near latitude 17.8 North, longitude 54.7 West. Cindy is 
moving quickly toward the northwest near 21 mph (33 km/h) and this 
motion is expected to continue, with a gradual slowdown. On the 
forecast track, Cindy should pass well to the northeast of the 
northernmost Leeward Islands. 
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Weakening is forecast over the next several days, and Cindy 
could degenerate into a trough of low pressure by the middle portion 
of this week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure recently measured by the Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunters is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
