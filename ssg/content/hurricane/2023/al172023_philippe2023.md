## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 18.3 North, longitude 55.0 West. Philippe is
moving toward the west-southwest near 5 mph (7 km/h).  A slow
westward or southwestward motion is expected during the next few
days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next few days, but

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
