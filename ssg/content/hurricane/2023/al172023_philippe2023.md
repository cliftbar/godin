## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 18.5 North, longitude 62.9 West. Philippe is
moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this general 
motion should continue today.  A turn toward the north-northwest is 
forecast by tonight, followed by a northward motion on Wednesday. 
On the forecast track, the center of Philippe is expected to move 
north of the Leeward Islands today.  However, the strongest winds 
and heaviest rains will likely occur in the islands to the south of 
the center.  
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next day or two,
but Philippe could begin to strengthen after midweek. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
primarily to the east and southeast of the center.  A wind gust to 
47 mph (76 km/h) was reported on Antigua a few hours ago. 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
