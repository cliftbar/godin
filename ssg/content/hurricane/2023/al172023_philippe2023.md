Rainfall will begin to affect Bermuda on Thursday with rainfall
totals of 3 to 6 inches expected through Friday.
 
These rainfall amounts may result in scattered flash flooding.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
Friday morning.  Gusty winds are likely to continue across portions
of the the Virgin Islands through today.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the

affecting Bermuda from another weather system but will begin to
increase further on Thursday as Philippe approaches the island.
These conditions are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
