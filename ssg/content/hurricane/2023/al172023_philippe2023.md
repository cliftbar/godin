## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 17.1 North, longitude 60.0 West. Philippe is
moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this motion 
is expected to continue through early Tuesday.  A turn toward the 
north-northwest is forecast to occur by late Tuesday, followed by a 
northward motion on Wednesday.  On the forecast track, the center of
Philippe is expected to pass near or just northeast of the northern
Leeward Islands later today and tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next day or so, but 
Philippe could begin to intensify more significantly around the 
middle of the week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km),
primarily east and southeast of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
