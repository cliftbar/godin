## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was 
located near latitude 18.0 North, longitude 55.9 West. Philippe is 
moving toward the west-southwest near 5 mph (7 km/h), and this 
motion is expected to continue through Saturday night.  A gradual 
turn toward the west and northwest is forecast Sunday and Sunday 
night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next few days.

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico through the weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
