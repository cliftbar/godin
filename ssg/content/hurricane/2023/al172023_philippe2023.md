## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 17.8 North, longitude 62.1 West.  Philippe is
moving toward the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and a
generally northwestward motion is forecast on Tuesday.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Philippe is expected to continue 
passing near the northern Leeward Islands tonight and early 
Tuesday, and move north of those islands by late Tuesday.  However, 
the strongest winds and heavy rains will likely occur in the islands 
to the south of the center.  A turn toward the north-northwest is 
forecast by late Tuesday, followed by a northward motion on 
Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next day or two,
but Philippe could begin to intensify more significantly around the
middle of the week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km) 
primarily to the east and southeast of the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft observations is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
