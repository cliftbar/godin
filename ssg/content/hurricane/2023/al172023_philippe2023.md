## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was 
located near latitude 20.5 North, longitude 65.5 West. Philippe is 
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A turn toward the 
north-northwest is forecast later today, followed by a faster motion 
toward the north on Thursday and Friday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Philippe will continue to move away from Puerto Rico and 
the Virgin Islands today.  Philippe will then approach Bermuda 
Thursday night and Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next day or so, 
but some gradual intensification could occur after that time.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
