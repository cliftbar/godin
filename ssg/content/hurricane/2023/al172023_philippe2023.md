## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 18.9 North, longitude 63.9 West.  Philippe is
moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A turn toward 
the north-northwest is expected later today, followed by a 
northward motion late Wednesday through Thursday.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Philippe is expected to pass just north of 
the British Virgin Islands today and then move away from the 
northern Leeward Islands beginning tonight.  However, the strongest 
winds and heaviest rains will likely occur in the islands to the 
southeast of the center.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast during the next 
couple of days.  Philippe could begin to strengthen a bit late this 
week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
primarily to the east and southeast of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Philippe is forecast to produce the following rainfall
amounts into early Wednesday:
 
Anguilla southward to Montserrat, including St. Kitts and Nevis,
and the British Virgin Islands:  4 to 8 inches with maximum amounts
to 12 inches.
 
The remainder of the Leeward Islands and northern Windward Islands:
1 to 4 inches
 
The U.S. Virgin Islands and northeast Puerto Rico: 2 to 4 inches
 
This rainfall would result in scattered flash flooding.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
warning area and possible within the watch area today.  Strong
gusty winds are also likely elsewhere in the Leeward Islands today.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico through midweek. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
