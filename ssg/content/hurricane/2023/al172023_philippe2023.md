## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 25.6 North, longitude 66.3 West.  Philippe is
moving toward the north near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general 
motion with an increase in forward speed is expected to continue 
through late Saturday.  A turn toward the north-northwest is 
possible Saturday night or early Sunday.  On the forecast track, 
the center of Philippe will near or just west of Bermuda on Friday, 
and then reach the coast of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, or eastern 
Maine Saturday night.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast during the 
next day or two.  Some strengthening is possible Friday night or 
Saturday, but Philippe is expected to become a post-tropical 
cyclone on Saturday as it approaches Atlantic Canada and eastern 
New England.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
to the east of the center.  Saildrone SD-1041, located about 135 
miles (215 km) southeast of Philippe's center, recently measured a 
sustained wind of 38 mph (60 km/h) and a gust to 45 mph (73 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
early Friday morning.
 
RAINFALL:  Rainfall will begin to affect Bermuda today with rainfall
totals of 3 to 5 inches expected through Friday. These rainfall
amounts could result in scattered flash flooding.
 
SURF:  Large swells are already affecting Bermuda from another
weather system but will begin to increase further later today as 
Philippe approaches the island.  Swells are also reaching portions 
of the southeastern U.S. coast and will spread northward along the 
east coast to Atlantic Canada during the next couple of days.  These 
conditions are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
currents.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
