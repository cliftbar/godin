## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 18.5 North, longitude 55.2 West.  Philippe is
moving toward the southwest near 2 mph (4 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue through Saturday night.  A gradual 
turn toward the west and northwest is forecast Sunday and Sunday 
night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is expected during the next day or so, 
but some strengthening is possible over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico through the weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
