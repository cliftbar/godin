Philippe was located near latitude 30.7 North, longitude 64.6 West.
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the north-northeast near
16 mph (26 km/h).  A northward or north-northwestward motion at a 
faster forward speed is expected during the next few days.  On the 
forecast track, the system will continue passing Bermuda today and 
will reach the coast of Atlantic Canada or eastern New England 
Saturday night or Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is possible over the next day or so.  
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
to the east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml
 
WIND:  Strong winds are possible over portions of Atlantic Canada
and eastern New England this weekend.
 
RAINFALL:  Rainfall will be diminishing across Bermuda today.  An
additional inch or less of rainfall is possible.
 
For portions of New York and New England, and Southeast Canada,
rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches, with local maximum amounts of 5
inches, are expected this weekend.  Isolated to scattered instances
of urban and flash flooding will be possible.
 
SURF:  Large swells will continue to affect Bermuda for the next
few days.  Swells are also affecting portions of the southeastern
U.S. coast and will spread northward along the east coast to
Atlantic Canada during the next couple of days.  These conditions
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
