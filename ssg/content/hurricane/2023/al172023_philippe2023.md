## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 16.4 North, longitude 58.2 West. Philippe is
moving toward the west near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A west-northwestward 
to northwestward motion is expected to begin today and continue 
into tonight.  A turn toward the northwest with an increase in 
forward speed is expected Sunday and Monday, followed by a northward 
motion on Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Philippe 
is forecast to pass near or just northeast of the northern Leeward 
Islands on Monday and Monday night. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is expected during the next day or 
so.  Some strengthening is possible by late Monday as Philippe 
begins to move north of the Leeward Islands. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km) 
primarily to the east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC. 

RAINFALL:  Philippe is forecast to produce 1 to 4 inches of rain
across portions of the Leeward Islands by Monday into Tuesday. This
rainfall may result in isolated flash flooding.

leeward islands by Monday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
