## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 31.7 North, longitude 68.3 West.  Lee is moving toward
the north near 15 mph (24 km/h) and this general motion with an
increase in forward speed is expected through Saturday.  A turn
toward the north-northeast and then northeast is forecast Saturday
night and Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Lee will
pass west of Bermuda through this evening, approach the coast
of New England and Atlantic Canada Friday and Saturday, and move
across Atlantic Canada Saturday night and Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected through Friday 
afternoon.  Some gradual weakening is forecast Friday night and 
Saturday, but Lee is expected to remain large and dangerous for the 
next couple of days.
 
Lee is a large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend outward up 
to 105 miles (165 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force 
winds extend outward up to 345 miles (555 km).  A sustained wind of 
40 mph (65 km/h) with a gust to 52 mph (83 km/h) was recently 
reported at the L.F. Wade International Airport on Bermuda.  NOAA 
buoy 41048 located about 75 miles (120 km) west of the center of 
Lee has recently reported a peak one-minute sustained wind of 
67 mph (108 km/h) and a gust to 87 mph (141 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 957 mb (28.26 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue on Bermuda through
Friday morning.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the Hurricane 
Watch areas in Down East Maine and in Atlantic Canada on Saturday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the southern New
England on Friday afternoon and spread northward within the 
Tropical Storm Warning area through Saturday.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the Tropical Storm Watch area in
Atlantic Canada by late Friday into Saturday.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Flushing, NY to U.S./Canada border...1-3 ft
Long Island Sound...1-3 ft
Cape Cod...1-3 ft
Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket...1-3 ft
Boston Harbor...1-3 ft
Rockaway Inlet, NY to Montauk Point, NY...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
A dangerous storm surge could produce coastal flooding within the
wind watch areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of onshore winds.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the
east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Outer rain bands from Lee may produce rainfall amounts of
1 to 2 inches, or 25 to 50 millimeters, across Bermuda tonight into
early Friday.
 
Friday night through Saturday night, Lee is expected to produce
rainfall amounts of 1 to 4 inches, or 25 to 100 millimeters, across
portions of eastern New England into portions of New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia. This may produce localized urban and small stream
flooding.
