## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 18.9 North, longitude 55.5 West. Lee is moving toward
the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this motion is
expected to continue through early next week with a significant
decrease in forward speed. On the forecast track, Lee is expected
to pass well to the north of the northern Leeward Islands, the
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico over the weekend and into early
next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 150 mph (240 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Lee is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are likely
over the next few days, however Lee is expected to remain a
powerful major hurricane through early next week. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 942 mb (27.82 inches).
