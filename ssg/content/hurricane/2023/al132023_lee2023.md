## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 28.0 North, longitude 67.7 West.  Lee is moving toward
the north near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A generally northward motion and an 
increase in forward speed are expected through Friday.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Lee will pass west of Bermuda 
Thursday and Thursday night and then approach the coast of New
England and Atlantic Canada Friday and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, but 
Lee is expected to remain a large and dangerous hurricane for the 
next couple of days.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 265
miles (425 km).
 
The minimum central pressure reported by a NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft is 953 mb (28.15 inches).
