## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 19.3 North, longitude 56.5 West.  Lee is moving toward
the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this motion is
expected to continue through early next week with a significant
decrease in forward speed.  On the forecast track, Lee is expected
to pass well to the north of the northern Leeward Islands, the
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico over the weekend and into early
next week.
 
Data from Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 115 
mph (185 km/h) with higher gusts.  Lee is a category 3 hurricane on 
the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Fluctuations in intensity 
are likely over the next few days, however Lee is expected to remain 
a powerful hurricane through early next week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 963 mb (28.44 inches).
