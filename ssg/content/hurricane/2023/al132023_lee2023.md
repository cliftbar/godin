## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located 
near latitude 23.9 North, longitude 64.8 West. Lee is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h). A slow west-northwest to 
northwest motion is expected during the next day or two, followed by 
a turn toward the north by midweek. On the forecast track, Lee is 
expected to pass near, but to the west of Bermuda in a few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Lee is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some slight strengthening is forecast in the 
next day or so, followed by gradual weakening. 
 
Lee remains large with hurricane-force winds extending outward up 
to 80 miles (130 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds 
extending outward up to 185 miles (295 km). Saildrone 1064, located 
about 40 miles south-southeast of Lee's center, reported a sustained 
wind of 77 mph (124 km/h) and a wind gust of 105 mph (170 km/h) in 
the last few hours.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 948 mb (28.00 inches). 
Saildrone 1064 also reported a minimum pressure of 964 mb     
(28.46 inches) in the last few hours.
