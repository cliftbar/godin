## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located 
near latitude 21.0 North, longitude 59.9 West. Lee is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A slower west-northwestward 
motion is expected during the next few days. On the forecast track, 
Lee is expected to pass well north of the northern Leeward Islands, 
the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico into early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Restrengthening is anticipated over the next day or two.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles 
(295 km). NOAA buoy 40144 located about 90 miles east-northeast of 
the center of Lee reported a peak sustained wind of 52 mph (83 
km/h) with a gust to 60 mph (98 km/h) within the past couple of 
hours.
 
The minimum central pressure measured by the NOAA hurricane hunter 
aircraft is 962 mb (28.41 inches).
