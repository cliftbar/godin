## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located 
near latitude 36.0 North, longitude 66.9 West. Lee is moving toward 
the north-northeast near 18 mph (30 km/h) and a northward motion at 
a faster forward speed is expected through Saturday.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Lee will continue to move farther away 
from Bermuda and approach the coast of New England and Atlantic 
Canada through Saturday.  Lee is then expected to turn toward the 
north-northeast and northeast and move across Atlantic Canada 
Saturday night and Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Lee is expected to be a large and dangerous storm 
when it reaches eastern New England and Atlantic Canada.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 320
miles (520 km).
 
The minimum central pressure is 962 mb (28.41 inches) based on data 
from the NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircrafts.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue on Bermuda during
the next few hours.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch areas in
Atlantic Canada on Saturday.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected to begin in southern New England late this afternoon and
spread northward across the rest of New England within the Tropical 
Storm Warning area through Saturday.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected to spread across the Tropical Storm Warning area in
Atlantic Canada tonight and Saturday.  These conditions are likely
to lead to downed trees and potential power outages.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the
east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Tonight through Saturday night, Lee is expected to
produce rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches, 50 to 100 millimeters,
in eastern Maine, western Nova Scotia, and portions of New
Brunswick. This could produce localized urban and small stream
flooding.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Flushing, NY to U.S./Canada border...1-3 ft
Long Island Sound...1-3 ft
Cape Cod...1-3 ft
Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket...1-3 ft
Boston Harbor...1-3 ft
Rockaway Inlet, NY to Montauk Point, NY...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
A dangerous storm surge will produce coastal flooding within the
wind warning areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of onshore winds.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
