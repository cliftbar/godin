## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 24.3 North, longitude 65.9 West. Lee is moving toward
the west-northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h).  A slow west-northwest to
northwest motion is expected during the next day or two, followed by
a turn toward the north by midweek. On the forecast track, Lee is
expected to pass near but to the west of Bermuda in a few days.
 
NOAA Hurricane Hunter data indicate that the maximum sustained
winds remain near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher gusts.  Lee is a
category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.
Some slow weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, but Lee
is expected to remain a large and powerful hurricane.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 951 mb (28.09 inches) 
based on dropsonde data.
