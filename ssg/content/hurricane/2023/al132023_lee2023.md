## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located 
near latitude 22.1 North, longitude 61.7 West. Lee is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A slower west-northwestward 
motion is expected during the next few days.  On the forecast track, 
Lee is expected to pass well north of the northern Leeward Islands, 
the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico during the next day or two.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that the maximum sustained winds have increased to near 120 mph (195 
km/h) with higher gusts.  Lee is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional strengthening 
is forecast during the next day or so.  Some fluctuations in 
intensity are possible on Monday and Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure reported by Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance is 954 mb (28.17 inches).
