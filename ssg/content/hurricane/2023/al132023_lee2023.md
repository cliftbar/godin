## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the clear eye of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 16.9 North, longitude 51.3 West. Lee is moving toward
the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h). The hurricane will
continue moving in this direction for the next several days while
gradually slowing down its forward speed. On the forecast track,
the core of Lee will move north of the northern Leeward Islands
during the next several days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have rapidly increased to near 130 mph
(215 km/h) with higher gusts. Lee is a category 4 hurricane on the
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Additional strengthening is
expected tonight. Fluctuations in intensity are expected after
that, but Lee is forecast to remain a powerful major hurricane 
well into next week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 953 mb (28.15 inches).
