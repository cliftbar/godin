## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 30.4 North, longitude 68.3 West. Lee is moving toward
the north near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this general motion with an
increase in forward speed is expected through Saturday.  A turn
toward the north-northeast and then northeast is forecast Saturday
night and Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Lee will
pass west of Bermuda today and tonight, approach the coast of New
England and Atlantic Canada Friday and Saturday, and move across
Atlantic Canada Saturday night and Sunday.
 
Data from Air Force Reserve and NOAA reconnaissance aircraft 
indicate that the maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 
km/h) with higher gusts. Weakening is forecast, but Lee is expected 
to remain a large and dangerous hurricane for the next couple of 
days.
 
Lee is a large hurricane. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up 
to 90 miles (150 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds 
extend outward up to 310 miles (500 km). A wind gust of 48 mph (78
km/h) has recently been reported at the L.F. Wade International
Airport on Bermuda.  NOAA buoy 41048 located about 130 miles (210 
km) northwest of the center of Lee has recently reported a peak 
one-minute sustained wind of 54 mph (86 km/h) and a gust to 67 mph 
(107 km/h).
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated from reconnaissance 
aircraft data is 956 mb (28.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue on Bermuda through
Friday.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch
areas in Down East Maine and in Atlantic Canada on Saturday. 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in Cape Cod, 
Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket on Friday afternoon. Tropical storm 
conditions are possible in the Tropical Storm Watch area elsewhere 
in coastal New England and Atlantic Canada late Friday into 
Saturday.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Chatham, MA to Sagamore Beach, MA...2-4 ft
Cape Cod Bay...2-4 ft
Nantucket...2-4 ft
Sagamore Beach, MA to Border of US/Canada...1-3 ft
Boston Harbor...1-3 ft
Flushing, NY to Chatham, MA...1-3 ft
Montauk Point, NY to Flushing, NY...1-3 ft
Long Island Sound...1-3 ft
Martha's Vineyard...1-3 ft
Rockaway Inlet, NY to Montauk Point, NY...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
A dangerous storm surge could produce coastal flooding within the
wind watch areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of onshore winds.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the
east coast of the United States, and are beginning to reach Atlantic
Canada.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Outer rain bands from Lee may produce rainfall amounts of 
1 to 2 inches, or 25 to 50 millimeters, across Bermuda today into 
early Friday.

Friday night through Saturday night, Lee is expected to produce 
rainfall amounts of 1 to 4 inches, or 25 to 100 millimeters, across 
portions of eastern New England into portions of New Brunswick and 
Nova Scotia. This may produce localized urban and small stream 
flooding.
