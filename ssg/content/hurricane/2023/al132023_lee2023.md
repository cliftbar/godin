## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 21.6 North, longitude 61.0 West. Lee is moving toward
the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A slower west- 
northwestward motion is expected during the next few days.  On
the forecast track, Lee is expected to pass well north of the
northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico 
during the next couple of days.
 
Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the 
maximum sustained winds have increased to near 110 mph (175 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast during the next 
couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure reported by NOAA reconnaissance 
aircraft is 958 mb (28.29 inches).
