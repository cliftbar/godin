Storm Melissa was located near latitude 14.3 North, longitude 71.7 
West. Melissa is moving toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A 
decrease in forward speed and a gradual turn to the  northwest and 
north is expected during the next few days.  On the forecast track, 
Melissa is expected to approach the southwestern portion of Haiti 
and Jamaica later this week.
 
Surface observations and satellite data indicate that the maximum 
sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. Gradual 
strengthening is expected during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
