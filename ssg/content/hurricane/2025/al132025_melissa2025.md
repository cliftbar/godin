## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Melissa was 
located near latitude 16.6 North, longitude 75.5 West. Melissa is 
moving toward slowly the west near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A slow westward 
motion is expected tonight through the end of the weekend. A turn to 
the north and northeast is forecast on Monday and Tuesday. On the 
forecast track, the center of Melissa is expected to move near or 
over Jamaica during the weekend and early next week, and it could be 
near or over eastern Cuba by the middle of next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 90 mph (150 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Rapid intensification is forecast to continue 
over the next day or so and Melissa is forecast to become a major 
hurricane tomorrow and is expected to still be a major hurricane 
when making landfall in Jamaica early next week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 974 mb (28.77 inches).
