located near latitude 15.4 North, longitude 74.9 West. Melissa is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 2 mph (4 km/h). A slow

of Haiti during the next couple of days.

followed by more rapid intensification this weekend.  Melissa is 
forecast to become a hurricane in a couple of days and a major 
hurricane by the end of the weekend.

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in 
Haiti and Jamaica beginning on late Friday or Saturday.  Tropical 
storm conditions are expected to begin in Jamaica earlier on Friday.

RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring 6 to 12 inches of rain to the 
southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica 
through Sunday, with locally higher amounts possible. Additional 
heavy rainfall is likely beyond Sunday. However, uncertainty in 
Melissaâ€™s track and forward speed reduces confidence in the exact 
totals. Regardless, significant, life-threatening flash flooding 
and numerous landslides are expected.

Across northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and western 
Jamaica, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected through Sunday. Flash and 
urban flooding will be possible through Sunday. Flooding impacts may 
increase across western Jamaica next week.
