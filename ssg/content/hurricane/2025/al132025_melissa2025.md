## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was 
located near latitude 16.0 North, longitude 74.3 West. Melissa is 
moving slowly toward the north near 2 mph (4 km/h). A turn to the 
west is forecast on Saturday and this general motion is expected to 
continue through Monday. A turn to the north and northeast is 
forecast on Tuesday and Wednesday. On the forecast track, the center 
of Melissa is expected to move near or over Jamaica early next week 
and could be near or over eastern Cuba by the middle of next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Rapid intensification is now forecast over the 
next several days, and Melissa is forecast to become a hurricane 
tomorrow and a major hurricane by Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in 
Haiti later this weekend and Jamaica beginning late this weekend or 
early next week. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in 
Haiti tonight or Saturday and in Jamaica late Saturday into Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring total rainfall of 15 to 25 
inches to portions of southern Hispaniola and Jamaica through 
Tuesday, with local maxima of 35 inches possible across the Tiburon 
Peninsula of Haiti.  Additional heavy rainfall is likely beyond 
Tuesday. The uncertainty at that time range precludes exact storm 
totals.  Potentially catastrophic flash flooding and landslides are 
possible across portions of Jamaica and the southern Dominican 
Republic, while catastrophic flash flooding is anticipated in 
southern Haiti.

For southeast Cuba, total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches, with local 
amounts to 12 inches, are possible into Tuesday.  Additional heavy 
rainfall is likely beyond Tuesday. The uncertainty at that time 
range precludes exact storm totals.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is likely along the coast of
Jamaica by Saturday in areas of onshore winds as tropical storm
conditions begin to reach the area.  

However, there is a risk of a more life-threatening storm surge, 
especially along the south coast of Jamaica, early next week.  Peak 
storm surge heights could reach 5 to 10 feet above ground level, 
near and to the east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall. 
This storm surge will be accompanied by large and destructive 
waves. 
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next several
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
