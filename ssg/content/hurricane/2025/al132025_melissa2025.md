HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone 
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti beginning late on Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions could 
begin in Jamaica on Thursday or Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is forecast to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain to 
southern Haiti and the southern Dominican Republic through Friday, 
with locally higher amounts possible.  Across eastern Jamaica, 4 to 
8 inches of rain is expected, also with locally higher amounts 
possible.  Additional heavy rainfall is possible beyond Friday; 
however, uncertainty in Melissaâ€™s track and forward speed reduces 
confidence in exact totals. Significant flash flooding and 
landslides are possible.

Across the northern Dominican Republic and northern Haiti, 2 to 4 
inches of rain is expected through Friday. For Aruba, western 
Jamaica, and Puerto Rico, 1 to 3 inches is expected through the same 
period. Flash and urban flooding will be possible through at least 
Friday.

Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total 
Rainfall Graphic, available at

SURF:  Swells generated by Melissa are expected to spread to
Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next couple of
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
