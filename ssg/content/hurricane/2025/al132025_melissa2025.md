## Official Advisory Discussion
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was
located near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 75.0 West. Melissa is
moving toward the northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A slow
west-northwestward to westward motion is expected today through 
Sunday night. A turn to the north and northeast is forecast on
Monday and Tuesday. On the forecast track, the center of Melissa
is expected to move near or over Jamaica during the weekend and
early next week, and it could be near or over eastern Cuba by the
middle of next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Rapid intensification is expected to begin soon. Melissa is 
forecast to become a hurricane today and a major hurricane by 
Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 986 mb (29.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in Jamaica by
tonight, with hurricane conditions expected by Sunday or Monday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected and hurricane conditions are
possible within the watch and warning area in Haiti later today.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring total rainfall of 15 to 25
inches to portions of southern Hispaniola and Jamaica through
Tuesday, with local maxima of 35 inches possible across the Tiburon
Peninsula of Haiti.  Additional heavy rainfall is likely beyond
Tuesday; uncertainty at that time range precludes exact storm
totals.  Potential catastrophic flash flooding and landslides are
possible across portions of Jamaica and the southern Dominican
Republic, while catastrophic flash flooding is anticipated in
southern Haiti.
 
For eastern Cuba, total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches, with local
amounts to 12 inches, is possible into Tuesday.  Additional heavy
rainfall is likely beyond Tuesday; uncertainty at that time range
precludes exact storm totals.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is likely along the coast of
Jamaica starting by tonight in areas of onshore winds as tropical
storm conditions begin to reach the area.
 
However, there is a risk of a more life-threatening storm surge,
especially along the south coast of Jamaica, later in the
weekend or early next week.  Peak storm surge heights could reach 5
to 10 feet above ground level, near and to the east of where the
center of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next several
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
