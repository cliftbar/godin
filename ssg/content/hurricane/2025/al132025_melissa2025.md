## Official Advisory Discussion
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was
located near latitude 16.2 North, longitude 75.5 West. Melissa is
moving toward the north near 3 mph (6 km/h). A slow northward or
north-northeastward motion is forecast during the next day or so,
followed by a sharp turn westward over the weekend. On the forecast
track, Melissa is expected to move closer to Jamaica and the
southwestern portion of Haiti during the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast over the next day or so, followed 
by rapid intensification this weekend.  Melissa is forecast to 
become a hurricane by Saturday and a major hurricane by the end of 
the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft data is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone 
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti and Jamaica beginning on Saturday. Tropical storm conditions 
are expected to begin in Haiti and Jamaica on Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring 8 to 14 inches of rain to the
southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica
through Sunday, with locally higher amounts possible. Additional
heavy rainfall is likely beyond Sunday; however, uncertainty in
Melissa's track and forward speed reduces confidence in exact
totals. Significant, life-threatening flash flooding and numerous
landslides are expected in the southern Dominican Republic and
eastern Jamaica, with catastrophic flash flooding and landslides
anticipated in southern Haiti.
 
Across the northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and western
Jamaica, 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected through Sunday. Flash 
and urban flooding will be possible through Sunday. Flooding impacts 
may increase across western Jamaica next week.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is likely along the coast of
Jamaica by late Friday into Saturday in areas of onshore winds as
tropical storm conditions begin to reach the area. However, there
is a potential risk of a more significant storm surge, especially
along the south coast of Jamaica, early next week.  Due to Melissa's
slow motion and large forecast uncertainty, it is still too soon to
know exactly how high the storm surge could reach.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next several
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
