HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti beginning on Friday.  Tropical storm conditions could begin in
Jamaica on Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain to the
southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica

heavy rainfall is possible beyond Sunday; however, uncertainty in
Melissaâ€™s track and forward speed reduces confidence in exact
totals. Significant, life-threatening flash flooding and numerous

western Jamaica, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected through Sunday.
Flash and urban flooding will be possible through at least Sunday.
