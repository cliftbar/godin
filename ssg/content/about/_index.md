This site is a place for me to post Hurricane model runs from a program I've developed in my free time.  The code is an implementaiton of the NWS 23 model developed by NOAA.  See my [Github](https://github.com/cliftbar) for various versions I've made over the years.

Oh, it's called "Odin" because my last name was silly and I had an idea for an icon, nothing too deep there.

*DISCLAIMER* Nothing on this site is official information or verified modeling, I'm just a dude on the internet.  Please follow all guidance from NOAA and your local officials.
